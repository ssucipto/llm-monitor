## What This Command Does

This command creates a new design document with intelligent namespace handling, optional draft file support, and automatic updates to package.yaml and README.md. It provides a guided workflow for creating well-structured design documents that follow ACP conventions.

**Key Features**:
- Context-aware (detects if in package vs project)
- Automatic namespace enforcement
- Draft file support with clarification workflow
- Auto-updates package.yaml and README.md
- Uses design.template.md as base

**Use this when**: Creating a new design document in an ACP project or package.  

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] ACP installed in current directory
- [ ] Design template exists (agent/design/design.template.md)
- [ ] (Optional) Draft file prepared if using draft workflow

---

## Arguments

**Context Capture Arguments** (optional — passed to `/acp-clarification-capture` directive):

| Argument | Alias | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `--from-clarification <file>` | `--from-clar` | Capture decisions from a specific clarification file |
| `--from-clarifications` | `--from-clars` | Capture from all recent clarifications |
| `--from-chat-context` | `--from-chat` | Capture decisions from chat conversation |
| `--from-context` | (none) | Shorthand for all sources (clarifications + chat) |
| `--include-clarifications` | (none) | Alias for `--from-clars` |
| `--no-commit` | (none) | Skip the automatic commit step after creation |

**Default behavior** (no flags): Auto-detect clarifications and context in session.

## Steps

### 0. Display Command Header

```
⚡ /acp-design-create
  Create design documents with namespace enforcement, draft support, and automatic package updates

  Usage:
    /acp-design-create                             Guided design creation
    /acp-design-create @my-draft.md                Create from draft file
    /acp-design-create --from-context              Capture from all sources
    /acp-design-create --no-commit                 Skip automatic commit

  Related:
    /acp-pattern-create    Create patterns
    /acp-command-create    Create commands
    /acp-package-validate  Validate package after creation
```

This step is informational only — do not wait for user input.

### 1. Detect Context

Determine if in package or project directory:

**Actions**:
- Check if package.yaml exists
- If package: Infer namespace from package.yaml, directory, or git remote
- If project: Use "local" namespace

**Expected Outcome**: Context detected, namespace determined  

### 2. Check for Draft File

Check if draft file was provided as argument (same as pattern-create and command-create).

**Expected Outcome**: Draft file read (if provided)  

### 2.5. Read Contextual Key Files

Before creating content, load relevant key files from the index.

**Actions**:
- Check if `agent/index/` directory exists
- If exists, scan for all `*.yaml` files (excluding `*.template.yaml`)
- Filter entries where `applies` includes `acp.design-create`
- Sort by weight descending, read matching files
- Produce visible output

**Note**: If `agent/index/` does not exist, skip silently.  

### 2.7. Capture Clarification Context

Invoke the `/acp-clarification-capture` shared directive to capture decisions from clarifications and/or chat context.

**Actions**:
- Read and follow the directive in [`agent/commands/acp.clarification-capture.md`](acp.clarification-capture.md)
- Pass through any `--from-*` arguments from this command's invocation
- If no `--from-*` flags specified: auto-detect clarifications in session (default behavior)
- If uncaptured clarifications detected, show warning and ask user whether to include
- Directive returns a "Key Design Decisions" markdown section (or nothing if no context)
- Hold the generated section for insertion during Step 5 (Generate Design File)

**Expected Outcome**: Key Design Decisions section generated (if context available), or skipped cleanly  

### 3. Collect Design Information

Gather information from user via chat:

**Information to Collect**:
- **Design name** (without namespace prefix)
  - Example: "architecture" (not "firebase.architecture")
  - Validation: lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens
- **Design description** (one-line summary)
  - Example: "Firebase integration architecture and patterns"
- **Design version** (default: 1.0.0)

**If no draft provided**:
- Ask: "Describe what you want this design document to cover" OR
- Offer: "Would you like to create an empty draft file first?"

**Expected Outcome**: All design metadata collected  

### 4. Process Draft (If Provided)

If draft file was provided, create clarification if needed (same as pattern-create).

**Expected Outcome**: Clarification created and answered (if needed)  

### 4.5. Review Related Patterns

Before generating the design, scan existing patterns to ensure alignment.

**Actions**:
- Check if `agent/patterns/` directory exists
- List all pattern files
- Read patterns related to the design topic:
  - Patterns whose name or description overlaps with the design subject
  - Architectural patterns that constrain implementation choices
  - Up to 3 most relevant patterns
- Ensure the design aligns with existing patterns and avoids duplication
- Reference relevant patterns in the design document

**Note**: If `agent/patterns/` does not exist, skip silently.  

### 5. Generate Design File

Create design file from template:

**Actions**:
- Determine full filename: `{namespace}.{design-name}.md`
- Copy from design.template.md
- Fill in metadata (name, version, date, description)
- If draft/clarification provided: Incorporate content
- If no draft: Create from template with user-provided description
- If Key Design Decisions section was generated in Step 2.7: Insert it into the design document
- **Label atomic design units with D-IDs.** As you write the design, assign `D<N>` IDs to every atomic, addressable chunk (key decisions, code/schema snippets, interfaces, algorithms, formulas, key invariants, diagrams — anything a task might later inline verbatim). Number sequentially across the whole document. Use one of these forms:
  - `### D1: Use SM-2 for scheduling` (for decisions / major sections)
  - `**D2: user_study_list table**` above a fenced SQL/TS block (for code/schema snippets)
  - `**D3: Effective priority formula**` as a standalone paragraph label (for algorithms / rules)

  Prose context surrounding a D-ID is just context — do NOT assign D-IDs to every paragraph. Only atomic units get IDs.

- **Populate the `/acp-meta.design` marker block** — the template ships with `{placeholder}` values; every one MUST be replaced before saving:
  - `topic:` — comma-separated keywords from the design name + user description
  - `description:` — one-line summary, <=150 chars (truncate with `…` if needed)
  - `informs:` — if the user named a spec this design derived (or will derive) into, use that spec path; otherwise omit the line
  - `depends_on:` — other design paths referenced (if any); otherwise omit
  - `decisions:` — list or range of D-IDs in the design. Use range form (`D1..D5`) when IDs are contiguous; list form (`D1, D3, D7`) otherwise. OMIT this line entirely if the design has no D-IDs (tiny designs may not need any).
  - `status:` — literal `draft`
  - `updated:` — today's ISO date
  - No `{placeholder}` text may remain.
- Save to `agent/design/{namespace}.{design-name}.md`

**Expected Outcome**: Design file created  

### 6. Update package.yaml (If in Package)

Add design to package.yaml contents (same as pattern-create and command-create).

**Expected Outcome**: package.yaml updated  

### 7. Update README.md (If in Package)

Update README contents section (same as pattern-create and command-create).

**Expected Outcome**: README.md updated with new design  

### 8. Prompt to Delete Draft (If Used)

If draft file was used, ask to delete it.

**Expected Outcome**: User chooses whether to keep draft  

### 9. Report Success

Display what was created.

**Expected Outcome**: User knows design was created successfully  

### 10. Prompt to Add to Key File Index

After successful creation, offer to add the new file to the index.

**Display**:
```
Would you like to add this to the key file index?
  - Yes, add to agent/index/local.main.yaml
  - No, skip
```

If yes:
- Prompt for weight (suggest 0.7 for designs), description, rationale, and applies values
- Add entry to `agent/index/local.main.yaml` (create file from template if it doesn't exist)

**Note**: If `agent/index/` does not exist, skip this step.

### 11. Commit Created Artifacts (MANDATORY unless `--no-commit`)

> **⚠️ CRITICAL**: This step is NOT optional unless `--no-commit` was specified. You MUST commit created artifacts before finishing. Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT ask the user whether to commit. Do NOT defer the commit to a later time. If `--no-commit` was passed, skip this step silently.

**Actions**:
- Stage all files created or modified during design creation:
  - Design file (`agent/design/{namespace}.{design-name}.md`)
  - `package.yaml` (if updated)
  - `README.md` (if updated)
  - Key file index (`agent/index/*.yaml`) if updated
- Do NOT stage clarification files (`agent/clarifications/*.md`) — these are not committed
- Invoke `@git.commit` with a message summarizing what was created (e.g., `feat(design): create {namespace}.{design-name} design document`)
- Verify the commit succeeded

**Expected Outcome**: All design artifacts committed to version control.

## Verification

- [ ] Context detected correctly (package vs project)
- [ ] Namespace inferred or determined
- [ ] Design information collected
- [ ] Draft processed (if provided)
- [ ] Design file created with correct namespace
- [ ] package.yaml updated (if package)
- [ ] README.md updated (if package)
- [ ] Design follows template structure
- [ ] All metadata filled in correctly
- [ ] **Design artifacts committed via `@git.commit` (MANDATORY — do not skip)**

## Expected Output

### Files Created
- `agent/design/{namespace}.{design-name}.md` - Design file
- `agent/clarifications/clarification-{N}-design-{name}.md` - Clarification (if draft was ambiguous)

### Files Modified
- `package.yaml` - Design added to contents (if package)
- `README.md` - Contents section updated (if package)

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating Design in Package

**Context**: In acp-firebase package directory  

**Invocation**: `/acp-design-create`  

**Result**: Creates `agent/design/firebase.architecture.md`, updates package.yaml and README.md  

### Example 2: Creating Design in Project

**Context**: In regular project (no package.yaml)  

**Invocation**: `/acp-design-create`  

**Result**: Uses "local" namespace, creates a gitignored instance design (`local.*` under `agent/design/`; ADR-29), no package updates

- **Executes**: None

### Network Access
- **APIs**: None
- **Repositories**: None

### Sensitive Data
- **Secrets**: Never include secrets in designs
- **Credentials**: Never include credentials

## Notes

- Design name should be descriptive and specific
- Namespace is automatically added to filename
- Draft files can be any format (free-form markdown)
- Clarifications are created only if draft is ambiguous
- package.yaml and README.md updates are automatic in packages
- In non-package projects, uses "local" namespace
