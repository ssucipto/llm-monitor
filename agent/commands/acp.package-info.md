**Solution**: Run `/acp-package-list` to see installed packages, check spelling  

### Issue 2: Modified status incorrect

**Symptom**: File shows [MODIFIED] but wasn't changed  

**Cause**: Line ending differences or encoding changes  

**Solution**: This is based on checksum comparison, file content differs from original  

### Issue 3: File version shows 0.0.0

**Symptom**: File version is 0.0.0  

**Cause**: Package didn't have package.yaml or file not listed
