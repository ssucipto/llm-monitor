# Command: sync

> **🤖 Agent Directive**: If you are reading this file, the command `/acp-sync` has been invoked. Follow the steps below to execute this command.

**Namespace**: acp  
**Version**: 1.2.0  
**Created**: 2026-02-16  
**Last Updated**: 2026-03-17  
**Status**: Active  
**Scripts**: None  

---

**Purpose**: Synchronize documentation with source code by identifying and updating stale documentation  
**Category**: Documentation  
**Frequency**: As Needed  

---

## What This Command Does

This command synchronizes ACP documentation with the actual source code implementation. It reads source files, compares them with design documents and patterns, identifies documentation drift, and updates stale documentation to match reality.

Use this command after making significant code changes, when you suspect documentation is outdated, or periodically to ensure documentation stays current. It's particularly useful after implementing features, refactoring code, or completing milestones.

Unlike `/acp-update` which updates progress tracking, `/acp-sync` focuses on keeping design documents, patterns, and technical documentation aligned with the actual codebase.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] ACP installed in project
- [ ] Source code exists to compare against
- [ ] Documentation exists in `agent/` directory (design, tasks, patterns)
- [ ] Scripts exist in `agent/scripts/` (if applicable)
- [ ] You have understanding of what changed in code

## Steps

### 0. Display Command Header

```
⚡ /acp-sync
  Synchronize documentation with source code by identifying and updating stale documentation

  Related:
    /acp-update    Update progress tracking (not documentation)
    /acp-validate  Validate documentation structure and consistency
    /acp-init      Includes sync as part of initialization
    /acp-report    Generate report including documentation status
```

This step is informational only — do not wait for user input.

### 1. Read Design Documents

Load all design documents to understand documented architecture.

**Actions**:
- Read all files in `agent/design/`
- Note documented features, patterns, and architecture
- Understand documented API contracts
- Identify documented dependencies
- List documented file structures

**Expected Outcome**: Documented architecture understood  

### 1.3. Scan Metadata Markers

Run the canonical marker parser once and hold its output for the rest of the sync cycle. Every subsequent step that needs spec/task/code/design metadata consumes this stream instead of re-reading files.

**1.3.0 — Driver check** (no-op if `agent/driver.yaml` absent):

> This step is a no-op if `agent/driver.yaml` does not exist.

If `agent/driver.yaml` exists:
- Source `agent/scripts/acp.driver-yaml.sh`
- Check `driver_is_native shell` — if false, the shell driver is delegated; use the configured backend to run scan scripts
- Log: "Driver config active: shell → [type]" when non-native

**Actions**:
- Invoke the parser:
  ```sh
  ./agent/scripts/acp.meta-scan.sh agent/
  ```
- Parse the flat `file:` / `kind:` / `key:` stream into an in-memory structure indexed by `kind`:
  ```
  specs:    { file_path → { topic, description, requirements, status, updated, ... } }
  tasks:    { file_path → { topic, milestone, spec, covers, status, updated, ... } }
  designs:  { file_path → { topic, informs, status, updated, ... } }
  code:     { file_path → { topic, implements, spec, file_role, status, updated, ... } }
  others:   { file_path → { kind, topic, ... } }  (clarifications, patterns, artifacts, milestones)
  ```
- If `acp.meta-scan.sh` returns empty output, no markers exist yet. Continue without the marker data; Step 1.4 will prompt the user to backfill.

**Expected Outcome**: Marker inventory available as structured data for Steps 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 5, and 6.  

### 1.4. Backfill Markers and Remove Superseded Prose Frontmatter

Two passes over marker-eligible files: (A) add markers where missing, (B) strip prose frontmatter fields that the marker now supersedes. Never silently write in either pass — always prompt per file with a diff-like preview.

**Pass A — Add missing markers**:
- For each directory in `agent/{specs,design,tasks,milestones,patterns,clarifications,artifacts}/`, list the files.
- Subtract the files already in the marker inventory from Step 1.3.
- For each remaining file (has no marker):
  1. Derive a proposed marker from the filename, the first-level heading (`# ...`), and any obvious metadata bullets at the top (e.g., `**Type**: ...`, `**Status**: ...`, `**Last Verified**: ...`).
  2. Display the proposed marker block in a diff-like preview.
  3. Ask: "Add this marker to `<path>`? (y/n/edit/skip all)"
  4. On `y`: insert the marker block immediately after the top-level heading.
  5. On `edit`: open the proposed block for user modification, then insert.
  6. On `skip all`: abort this pass for the remainder of the sync cycle.
- Re-run Step 1.3 if any markers were added so downstream steps see the new entries.

**Pass B — Remove superseded prose frontmatter**:

Markers are the source of truth. When a file carries both a marker AND a prose field that the marker supersedes, the prose field is stale and must be removed. The following prose fields are superseded by marker fields and should be stripped:

| Prose field | Superseded by marker field | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| `**Status**: ...` | `status:` | spec, task, design, milestone, pattern, clarification, research/glossary/reference |
| `**Last Updated**: ...` | `updated:` | spec |
| `**Last Verified**: ...` | `last_verified:` | research/glossary/reference |
| `**Confidence**: ...` | `confidence:` | research/glossary/reference |
| `**Milestone**: ...` (if marker `milestone:` present and matches) | `milestone:` | task |
| `**Dependencies**: ...` | `depends_on:` | task, milestone |
| `**Applicable To**: ...` | `applies_to:` | pattern |

- For every file in the marker inventory (Step 1.3), grep its prose for any of the superseded fields above.
- For each hit, display a diff showing the proposed deletion.
- Ask: "Remove superseded `**<Field>**: <value>` from `<path>`? The marker's `<field>: <value>` supersedes it. (y/n/skip all)"
- On `y`: delete the prose line.
- On `n`: leave it (user will address manually).
- On `skip all`: abort this pass.

Fields that remain in prose (not superseded, do NOT strip): `**Namespace**`, `**Version**`, `**Created**` (immutable), `**Design Reference**`, `**Estimated Time**`, `**Duration**`, `**Goal**`, `**Concept**`, `**Purpose**`, `**Category**`, `**Type**`, `**Sources**`, `**Total Terms**`.

**Pass C — Backfill D-IDs in legacy designs**:

Designs created before v5.41.0 don't have D-IDs. Tasks can't claim `incorporates:` against them, so the validate Probe 2 falls back to a holistic check. Backfilling D-IDs restores exact traceability.

- For each design file in the marker inventory (kind: design) whose marker has no `decisions:` field OR whose body contains no D-ID patterns (`**D\d+[:\s*]` or `### D\d+:`):
  1. Read the design file.
  2. Identify candidate atomic units: headings under `## Key Decisions`, fenced code blocks (SQL, TS, Python, YAML), standalone tables, definition paragraphs introduced by `**Term**:`, or short `### SubHeading` sections that contain a single atomic idea.
  3. For each candidate, propose a D-ID label and a short title derived from the content (e.g. `D2: user_study_list table` for a SQL block following a "Data Model" heading).
  4. Display a list of proposed D-ID additions:
     ```
     Design: agent/design/acp-commands-design.md (instance designs are local-only — ADR-29)
       D1: Use SM-2 for vocab scheduling (from ### heading)
       D2: user_study_list table (from SQL block)
       D3: Attention score formula (from code paragraph)
       D4: Letter frequency mapping (from table)
       ...
     Apply all / edit / skip all?
     ```
  5. On approval: insert D-ID labels into the design body at the identified locations, and update the marker's `decisions:` field with the resulting range or list.
  6. On edit: let the user remove specific candidates from the proposal before applying.
  7. Never silently writes.

**Expected Outcome**: Every marker-eligible file has a marker (or was explicitly skipped) AND contains no superseded prose frontmatter fields AND (for designs) has D-IDs on atomic units where applicable.

**If no files need any pass**: skip silently.

### 1.5. Build Spec Inventory from Markers

Source the spec requirement surface from the marker stream (Step 1.3) instead of re-reading every spec file.

**Actions**:
- From `specs:` in the Step 1.3 inventory, extract each spec's `requirements:` field (e.g., `R1..R30` or `R1, R3, R7`).
- Expand range notation: `R1..R30` → `R1, R2, ..., R30`.
- Build the requirement inventory: `{ spec_path → [R1, R2, ..., R<N>] }`.
- For behavior scenarios and test names, fall back to reading the `## Behavior Table` and `## Tests` sections of each spec file — markers don't carry these (by design; they'd balloon). Only open each spec once, not per-task.

**Expected Outcome**: Complete spec requirement inventory keyed by spec path.

### 1.6. Cross-Reference Specs with Task Claims (Marker-Driven)

Determine which spec requirements are claimed by which tasks, and flag unclaimed ones.

**Actions**:
- From `tasks:` in the Step 1.3 inventory, extract each task's `spec:` and `covers:` fields.
- Skip tasks with no `covers:` (they claim no spec requirements).
- Build the claims inventory: `{ spec_path → { R<N>: [task_paths] } }`.
- Compare against the requirement inventory from Step 1.5. Classify each R<N> as:
  - **Claimed** — at least one task's `covers:` field contains it
  - **Unclaimed** — in the spec's `requirements:` but no task claims it
  - **Duplicated** — claimed by more than one task (possibly intentional; flag for review)
- Classify each claimed requirement further using the `code:` inventory from Step 1.3:
  - **Implemented** — at least one code marker's `implements:` field contains this R<N> AND references the same spec
  - **Unimplemented** — claimed by a completed task (`status: complete`) but no code marker implements it
  - **Partial** — claimed by a task and some but not all sub-clauses are covered by code markers (judgment call; flag for review)

**Expected Outcome**: Traceability map of spec R<N> → task claims → code implementation status, derived from marker data in one pass.  

### 2. Read Task Documents

Review task documents to understand documented implementation approach.

**Actions**:
- Read all files in `agent/tasks/`
- Note documented implementation steps
- Identify documented tools and dependencies
- Check for code examples in task steps
- List documented functions and approaches

**Expected Outcome**: Documented implementation approach understood  

### 3. Read Artifact Documents

Review artifact documents to understand committed reference material.

**Actions**:
- Read all files in `agent/artifacts/` (research, glossary, reference)
- Note **Last Verified** dates for each artifact
- Parse artifact metadata (Created, Status, Confidence, Category)
- Identify artifact claims (findings, terms, standards, diagrams, schemas)
- Flag artifacts with Last Verified > 6 months old as potentially stale

**Expected Outcome**: Artifact inventory with staleness indicators  

### 4. Read Source Code

Review actual implementation in source files.

**Actions**:
- Identify main source directories (src/, lib/, cmd/, etc.)
- Read key implementation files
- Note actual features implemented
- Understand actual architecture
- Identify actual dependencies and tools used
- Document actual file structures
- Check which functions/utilities are actually implemented
- **Compare implementation approach with task document examples**
- **Note new terms, patterns, or concepts not in glossaries**

**Expected Outcome**: Actual implementation understood  

### 5. Compare Documentation vs Reality

Identify discrepancies between docs and code.

**Actions**:
- Compare documented features with implemented features
- **Compare documented tools (e.g., yq) with actual tools (e.g., acp.yaml-parser.sh)**
- **Compare documented functions with actual implementations**
- **Check if task code examples match actual code in scripts**
- Check if documented patterns match actual patterns
- Verify API contracts match implementation
- Compare file structures
- Note undocumented features in code
- Identify documented features not yet implemented
- **Flag task documents with outdated code examples**
- **Compare artifact claims with current codebase**:
  - **Research artifacts**: Verify findings still apply (technology versions, benchmarks, recommendations)
  - **Glossary artifacts**: Check for new terms in code not in glossary, verify existing definitions
  - **Reference artifacts**: Verify config tables, standards, schemas match current code
- **Compare spec requirements with implementation** (using the claims map from Step 1.6):
  - **Unclaimed requirements**: R<N> exists in `agent/specs/` but no task claims it in Spec Coverage. This is a *planning gap* — either a task should be created, or the requirement should be explicitly marked as deferred/out-of-scope in the spec itself.
  - **Unimplemented claims**: R<N> claimed by a completed task but no implementation found in code. This is *completion drift* — the task was marked done without satisfying the claim.
  - **Partial claims**: R<N> has some implementation but not all MUST clauses are satisfied.
  - **Drifted implementations**: Implementation exists and differs from the spec's MUST language (e.g., spec says "must use formula X", code uses formula Y).
  - **Stale requirements**: Requirement text in spec no longer matches current behavior (spec itself needs updating).

**Expected Outcome**: Documentation drift identified (including implementation details, artifact staleness, and spec/task/code traceability gaps)  

### 6. Identify Stale Documentation

Determine which documents need updates.

**Actions**:
- List design docs that are outdated
- **List task docs with outdated code examples or tool references**
- Note patterns that don't match code
- Identify missing documentation for new features
- Flag incorrect technical specifications
- **Flag task documents referencing wrong tools (e.g., yq vs acp.yaml-parser.sh)**
- **Flag stale artifacts**:
  - Research artifacts with outdated version numbers or deprecated recommendations
  - Glossary artifacts missing new terms from codebase
  - Reference artifacts with incorrect config tables, standards, or schemas
  - Artifacts with Last Verified > 6 months ago
- **Flag spec drift** (using findings from Step 5):
  - List every **unclaimed requirement** — these are planning gaps the user should resolve (create a task, defer in spec, or remove if out-of-scope)
  - List every **unimplemented claim** — these are completion drifts that should re-open their owning task
  - List every **drifted implementation** — these need a decision: update the spec or update the code
  - Do NOT auto-update the spec to match drifted code — spec is the source of truth; drift means the code is wrong until the user says otherwise
- Prioritize updates by importance

**Expected Outcome**: Update priorities established (including artifact refresh needs and spec drift findings)  

### 7. Update Design Documents

Refresh design documents to match reality.

**Actions**:
- Update feature descriptions
- Correct technical specifications
- Update code examples to match actual code
- Add notes about implementation differences
- Update status fields (Proposal → Implemented)
- Add "Last Updated" dates

**Expected Outcome**: Design docs reflect reality  

### 8. Update Task Documents

Refresh task documents to match actual implementation.

**Actions**:
- **Update code examples in task steps to match actual code**
- **Replace references to external tools with actual tools used**
- **Update function names to match actual implementations**
- **Add notes about completed vs remaining work**
- **Update Common Issues sections**
- Mark completed steps as done

**Expected Outcome**: Task docs reflect actual implementation approach  

### 9. Update Pattern Documents

Refresh patterns to match actual usage.

**Actions**:
- Update pattern examples with real code
- Correct pattern descriptions
- Add new patterns discovered in code
- Update anti-patterns based on lessons learned
- Ensure code examples compile/work

**Expected Outcome**: Patterns match actual usage  

### 10. Update Artifact Documents

Refresh artifacts to match current codebase and technology landscape.

**Actions**:
- **Research artifacts**:
  - Verify technology versions still current
  - Check if recommendations still apply
  - Update Last Verified date if validated
  - Mark as Stale if outdated (triggers user to refresh or deprecate)
- **Glossary artifacts**:
  - Add new terms discovered in codebase (use `/acp-artifact-glossary --update`)
  - Verify existing definitions still accurate
  - Update Last Verified date
- **Reference artifacts**:
  - Update config tables to match current .env files
  - Update standards to match current code style
  - Update schemas to match current data models
  - Update Last Verified date
- **General**:
  - Flag artifacts as Stale if Last Verified > 6 months and changes detected
  - Suggest `/acp-artifact-research` re-run for outdated research
  - Update artifact metadata (Last Verified, Status, Confidence if changed)

**Expected Outcome**: Artifacts current with codebase  

### 11. Document New Features

Add documentation for undocumented features.

**Actions**:
- Create design docs for undocumented features
- Document new patterns found in code
- Add technical specifications

**Actions**:
- Add recent work entry for sync
- Note what was updated (including artifacts refreshed)
- Update documentation counts if needed
- Add notes about documentation status
- Note artifact staleness warnings

**Expected Outcome**: Sync activity tracked

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Can't determine what changed

**Symptom**: Unclear what documentation needs updating  

**Cause**: Too many changes or unclear code  

**Solution**: Review git commits since last sync, focus on major changes first, update incrementally  

### Issue 2: Documentation and code both seem wrong

**Symptom**: Neither docs nor code match expected behavior  

**Cause**: Requirements changed or misunderstood  

**Solution**: Clarify requirements first, then update both code and docs to match correct requirements  

### Issue 3: Too many discrepancies to fix

**Symptom**: Overwhelming number of outdated docs  

**Cause**: Long time since last sync  

**Solution**: Prioritize by importance, fix critical docs first, schedule time for rest, sync more frequently going forward

## Notes

- This command can be time-consuming for large projects
- Focus on high-priority documentation first
- Sync regularly to avoid large drift
- Use git diff to see what changed in code
- Document the "why" not just the "what"
- Keep code examples working and tested
- Update "Last Updated" dates in documents
- Consider running after each milestone completion
