**Purpose**: List all projects registered in global workspace  
**Category**: Utility  
**Frequency**: As Needed  

---

## What This Command Does

Lists all projects registered in `~/.acp/projects.yaml` with their metadata. Shows project type, status, description, git origin (when available), and last accessed time. Highlights the current active project with a ⭐ marker.

**Key Distinction**: This command lists projects IN the registry. Use `/acp-projects-sync` to discover projects NOT YET registered.  

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Global ACP initialized (`~/.acp/` exists)
- [ ] Projects registry exists (`~/.acp/projects.yaml`)
- [ ] At least one project registered

### 1. Run Shell Script

Execute the project list script with optional filters.

**Actions**:
- Run `./agent/scripts/acp.project-list.sh`
- Pass filter arguments if needed
- Script reads `~/.acp/projects.yaml`
- Displays formatted project list

**Expected Outcome**: Project list displayed  

### 2. Review Output

Examine the project list and identify projects of interest.

**Actions**:
- Note current project (marked with ⭐)
- Review project types and statuses
- Check last accessed timestamps
- Identify projects to switch to or investigate

**Expected Outcome**: Projects understood

## Verification

- [ ] Script executed successfully
- [ ] Projects displayed with correct formatting
- [ ] Current project marked with ⭐
- [ ] Filtering works correctly (if used)
- [ ] No errors encountered

## Arguments

### Optional Filters

- `--type <type>` - Filter by project type (e.g., `mcp-server`, `web-app`, `cli-tool`)
- `--status <status>` - Filter by status (`active`, `archived`, `paused`)
- `--tags <tag1,tag2>` - Filter by tags (comma-separated) [Not yet implemented]

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: No registry found

**Symptom**: "No projects registry found"  

**Cause**: Global ACP not initialized or registry not created  

**Solution**: Run `/acp-project-create` to create first project (auto-initializes registry)  

### Issue 2: No projects shown

**Symptom**: "No projects registered yet"  

**Cause**: Registry exists but is empty  

**Solution**: Create projects with `/acp-project-create` or discover existing projects with `/acp-projects-sync`  

### Issue 3: Filters return no results

**Symptom**: "No projects match filters"  

**Cause**: No projects match the specified filter criteria  

**Solution**: Remove filters or adjust filter values to match existing projects

## Notes

- This command reads from the registry, not the filesystem
- Current project is determined from `current_project` field in registry
- Projects are displayed in the order they appear in the YAML file
- Tag filtering is planned but not yet implemented
- Empty registry is handled gracefully with helpful message
