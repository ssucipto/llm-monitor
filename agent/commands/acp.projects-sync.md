**Namespace**: acp  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Created**: 2026-02-26  
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-26  
**Status**: Experimental  
**Scripts**: acp.projects-sync.sh  

---

**Purpose**: Discover unregistered ACP projects in `~/.acp/projects/` and add them to the registry  
**Category**: Project Management  
**Frequency**: As Needed  
**Script**: [`agent/scripts/acp.projects-sync.sh`](../scripts/acp.projects-sync.sh)  

---

## What This Command Does

This command scans the `~/.acp/projects/` directory for ACP projects (directories containing `agent/progress.yaml`) and prompts you to register any that aren't already in the registry.

**Use this when**:
- You have existing projects in `~/.acp/projects/` before the registry was implemented
- You manually created project directories without using `/acp-project-create`
- You want to discover and organize all your ACP projects

**Key Distinction**:
- `/acp-project-list` - Lists projects **IN** the registry (reads YAML)
- `/acp-projects-sync` - Discovers projects **NOT** in registry (scans filesystem)

## Prerequisites

- [ ] `~/.acp/projects/` directory exists
- [ ] At least one ACP project in `~/.acp/projects/` (has `agent/progress.yaml`)
- [ ] Registry system initialized (auto-initializes if needed)

## Steps

### 0. Display Command Header

```
⚡ /acp-projects-sync
  Discover unregistered ACP projects and add them to the registry

  Related:
    /acp-project-list        List all registered projects
    /acp-project-info        View project details
    /acp-project-set         Switch to a project
    /acp-project-create      Create new project (auto-registers)
    /acp-projects-restore    Restore projects from git origins
```

### 1. Execute Sync Script

Run the shell script to scan for unregistered projects.

**Actions**:
- Execute `./agent/scripts/acp.projects-sync.sh`
- Script scans `~/.acp/projects/` directory
- Identifies ACP projects (has `agent/progress.yaml`)
- Checks registry for each project
- Prompts for unregistered projects

**Expected Outcome**: Interactive prompts for each unregistered project  

### 2. Review Each Unregistered Project

For each unregistered project found, review the metadata.

**Actions**:
- Read project type from `progress.yaml`
- Read project description from `progress.yaml`
- Display metadata to user
- Prompt: "Register this project? (Y/n)"

**Expected Outcome**: User decides whether to register each project  

### 3. Register Selected Projects

Register projects that user confirms.

**Actions**:
- Call `register_project()` for confirmed projects
- Add to `~/.acp/projects.yaml` registry
- Set timestamps (created, modified, accessed)
- Display success message

**Expected Outcome**: Selected projects added to registry  

### 4. Backfill Git Info

For already-registered projects, detect and backfill missing `git_origin` and `git_branch`.

**Actions**:
- Iterate registered projects missing `git_origin`
- Auto-detect from `git remote get-url origin`
- Auto-detect branch from `git branch --show-current`
- Write backfilled data to registry

**Expected Outcome**: Existing projects gain git_origin/git_branch fields  

### 5. Display Summary

Show sync results.

**Actions**:
- Count total projects found
- Count newly registered projects
- Count backfilled git origins
- Display summary statistics
- Suggest running `/acp-project-list`

**Expected Outcome**: User knows what was registered and backfilled

## Examples

### Example 1: First Time Sync

**Context**: User has 3 projects in `~/.acp/projects/`, none registered  

**Invocation**: `/acp-projects-sync`  

**Result**:
- Finds 3 projects
- Prompts for each one
- User registers all 3
- Summary: "Found: 3 projects, Registered: 3 new projects"

### Example 2: Partial Sync

**Context**: User has 5 projects, 2 already registered  

**Invocation**: `/acp-projects-sync`  

**Result**:
- Finds 5 projects total
- Shows "already registered" for 2
- Prompts for 3 unregistered
- User registers 2, skips 1
- Summary: "Found: 5 projects, Registered: 2 new projects"

### Example 3: No New Projects

**Context**: All projects already registered  

**Invocation**: `/acp-projects-sync`  

**Result**:
- Finds all projects
- All show "already registered"
- No prompts
- Summary: "Found: 4 projects, Registered: 0 new projects"

### Example 4: Empty Directory

**Context**: `~/.acp/projects/` is empty  

**Invocation**: `/acp-projects-sync`  

**Result**:
- No projects found
- Summary: "Found: 0 projects, Registered: 0 new projects"

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: No projects found

**Symptom**: "Found: 0 projects"  

**Cause**: No directories in `~/.acp/projects/` with `agent/progress.yaml`  

**Solution**: 
- Check if projects exist in `~/.acp/projects/`
- Verify projects have `agent/progress.yaml` file
- Projects without `agent/progress.yaml` are not ACP projects

### Issue 2: Registry not found

**Symptom**: Error about missing registry  

**Cause**: `~/.acp/projects.yaml` doesn't exist  

**Solution**: Script auto-initializes registry, but if error persists:  
```bash
# Initialize global ACP
~/.acp/agent/scripts/acp.common.sh
init_projects_registry
```

### Issue 3: Cannot read progress.yaml

**Symptom**: "Type: unknown, Description: No description"  

**Cause**: `progress.yaml` is malformed or missing fields  

**Solution**: 
- Check `progress.yaml` syntax
- Ensure `project.type` and `project.description` fields exist
- Project will still register with default values

### Issue 4: Permission denied

**Symptom**: Cannot write to registry  

**Cause**: No write permission for `~/.acp/projects.yaml`  

**Solution**:
```bash
chmod 644 ~/.acp/projects.yaml
```

---

## Security Considerations

### File Access
- **Reads**: `~/.acp/projects/*/agent/progress.yaml` (project metadata)
- **Reads**: `~/.acp/projects.yaml` (registry)
- **Writes**: `~/.acp/projects.yaml` (adds new entries)
- **Executes**: None

### Network Access
- **APIs**: None
- **Repositories**: None

### Sensitive Data
- **Secrets**: Does not read `.env` files or credentials
- **Credentials**: Does not access any credentials

### User Interaction
- **Prompts**: Yes - confirms each registration
- **Confirmation**: Required for each project
- **Auto-actions**: None without confirmation

---

## Notes

- This command is **interactive** - requires user input
- Projects are registered with metadata from `progress.yaml`
- Already-registered projects are automatically skipped
- Only scans `~/.acp/projects/` directory (not subdirectories)
- Only detects ACP projects (must have `agent/progress.yaml`)
- Non-ACP directories are ignored
- Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)
- Does not modify project files, only registry
- Multiline descriptions are truncated to 80 characters
- Automatically detects and stores `git_origin` and `git_branch` for new registrations
- Backfills `git_origin`/`git_branch` for already-registered projects missing them

---

## Implementation Details

### Detection Logic

A directory is considered an ACP project if:
1. It's a directory in `~/.acp/projects/`
2. It contains `agent/progress.yaml` file

### Metadata Extraction

Metadata is read from `agent/progress.yaml`:
- `project.type` → Project type
- `project.description` → Project description

If fields are missing, defaults are used:
- Type: "unknown"
- Description: "No description"

### Registration Process

For each unregistered project:
1. Display project name, type, description
2. Prompt user: "Register this project? (Y/n)"
3. If yes (or Enter): Call `register_project()`
4. If no: Skip and continue

### Registry Update

Uses existing infrastructure:
- `register_project()` from `acp.common.sh`
- Adds entry to `~/.acp/projects.yaml`
- Sets timestamps automatically
- Updates registry metadata
