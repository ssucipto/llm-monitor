## Arguments

This command supports both CLI-style flags and natural language arguments.

### Completion Flags (all equivalent — trigger autonomous mode)

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--complete` | Complete all remaining tasks in current milestone |
| `--finish-milestone` | Same as `--complete` (explicit name) |
| `--auto` | Same as `--complete` (short form) |
| `--autonomous` | Same as `--complete` (explicit form) |

### Commit Flags (all equivalent — implied by `--complete`)

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--commit` | Run `@git.commit` after each task |
| `--commit-each` | Same as `--commit` (explicit name) |
| `--with-commits` | Same as `--commit` (modifier style) |

**Note**: `--complete` implies `--commit`. There is no autonomous completion mode without per-task commits.  

### Targeting Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--this` | Work on the task already in chat context or implied by the current conversation, rather than scanning progress.yaml for the next task |

### Execution Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--parallel` | Spin up sub-agents to work on tasks concurrently (does **not** imply worktrees — see `--worktrees`) |
| `--worktrees` | Use separate git worktrees for parallel sub-agents. Only meaningful with `--parallel`. Default: **off** |
| `--noworktrees` | Explicitly disable worktrees (this is the default — provided for clarity) |
| `--yes` | Skip the confirmation prompt (A2) and begin execution immediately |
| `--dry-run` | Preview what tasks would be completed without executing |
| `--noworktreemerge` | Do not auto-merge worktrees when sub-agents complete; prompt for permission before each merge (see A10). Only meaningful with `--worktrees` |
| `--stacked` | Complete entire milestone using stacked worktrees — each task branches from the previous. Never merges to main until user approves. Implies `--complete --worktrees`. See **Stacked Worktree Mode** (A11) |

#### Future Flags (not yet implemented)

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dag` | Parallel-within-stack using plan dependencies. Same stacked worktree model but independent tasks fan out concurrently. Requires `/acp-plan` dependency graph |
| `--graph` | Same as `--dag` |

#### `--noworktreemerge` Aliases (all equivalent)

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--noworktreemerge` | Canonical form |
| `--holdmerge` | Short form — "hold the merge until I say go" |
| `--safemerge` | Emphasizes safety of sequential merging |
| `--safe` | Shortest form — not overloaded, well-documented |

### Combo Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--turbo` | Shorthand for `--auto --this --yes` |
| `--yolo` | Same as `--turbo` |

**`--turbo` / `--yolo` expand to**: autonomous mode, targeting the current/contextual task, no confirmation prompt. Does **not** imply `--parallel` or worktrees — add `--worktrees` explicitly if you want parallel worktree sub-agents.

### Natural Language (Fuzzy Matching)

The agent should detect autonomous intent from natural language following `/acp-proceed`:

| Example | Detected Mode |
|---------|---------------|
| `/acp-proceed --complete` | Autonomous |
| `/acp-proceed finish milestone` | Autonomous |
| `/acp-proceed finish milestone and iteratively commit` | Autonomous |
| `/acp-proceed just finish everything` | Autonomous |
| `/acp-proceed complete the milestone` | Autonomous |
| `/acp-proceed complete all tasks` | Autonomous |
| `/acp-proceed --dry-run` | Dry-Run |
| `/acp-proceed --turbo` | Autonomous (no confirm, contextual task) |
| `/acp-proceed --yolo` | Same as `--turbo` |
| `/acp-proceed --yolo --worktrees` | Autonomous with parallel worktree sub-agents |
| `/acp-proceed --yolo --worktrees --safe` | Autonomous parallel worktrees, prompt before each merge |
| `/acp-proceed --yolo hold merge` | Same as `--yolo --worktrees --safe` (NLP) |
| `/acp-proceed --yolo wait before merging` | Same as `--yolo --worktrees --safe` (NLP) |
| `/acp-proceed --stacked` | Stacked worktree mode (full milestone) |
| `/acp-proceed --yolo --stacked` | Stacked worktree mode, skip confirmation |
| `/acp-proceed stack the milestone` | Stacked worktree mode (NLP) |
| `/acp-proceed` | Single-Task (default) |

**Matching rules**:
- Look for keywords: `complete`, `finish`, `auto`, `autonomous`, `all tasks`, `everything`, `milestone`, `turbo`, `yolo`
- Look for `--worktrees` keywords: `worktree`, `worktrees`, `use worktrees`, `with worktrees`
- Look for `--noworktreemerge` keywords: `safe`, `hold merge`, `wait before merging`, `pause before merge`, `defer merge`, `don't auto-merge`, `gate merge`, `prompt before merge`, `no auto merge` — these **imply `--worktrees`** (you can't gate merges without worktrees)
- Look for `--stacked` keywords: `stack`, `stacked`, `stack the milestone`, `stacked worktrees`, `use stacked`, `chain worktrees` — these imply `--complete --worktrees`
- Be generous with matching — if the user's intent is clearly "do everything", enter autonomous mode
- When in doubt, **always show the confirmation prompt** before starting autonomous execution
- Never enter autonomous mode silently — the confirmation gate is mandatory

### Flag Combinations

| Combination | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| `--complete` | Autonomous completion with per-task commits |
| `--complete --yes` | Autonomous completion, skip confirmation prompt |
| `--complete --parallel` | Autonomous completion with parallel sub-agents (no worktrees unless `--worktrees`) |
| `--complete --parallel --worktrees` | Autonomous completion with parallel worktree sub-agents |
| `--complete --this` | Autonomous completion starting from contextual task |
| `--turbo` / `--yolo` | `--auto --this --yes` (full autonomous, no confirm, contextual) |
| `--yolo --parallel --worktrees` | Full autonomous parallel with worktree sub-agents |
| `--yolo --worktrees --safe` | Autonomous parallel worktrees, but prompt user before each merge |
| `--complete --parallel --worktrees --safe` | Autonomous parallel worktrees with merge gating |
| `--stacked` | Stacked worktree mode — sequential tasks, each branching from previous, no merge to main until approved |
| `--yolo --stacked` | Stacked worktree mode, skip confirmation |
| `--stacked --dry-run` | Preview stacked task list, no execution |
| `--complete --dry-run` | Preview task list, no execution |
| `--dry-run` (alone) | Preview next task only |
| `--commit` (alone) | Single-task mode, commit after completion |
| (no flags) | Single-task mode, no auto-commit |

## What This Command Does

**THIS IS AN IMPLEMENTATION COMMAND.**

### Default Mode (No Arguments)

When you invoke `/acp-proceed` without arguments:
1. Find the current/next task
2. **IMMEDIATELY START IMPLEMENTING IT**
3. Write code, create files, make changes
4. Complete the task or make substantial progress
5. Update progress tracking

### Autonomous Mode (With `--complete` or Natural Language)

When you invoke `/acp-proceed --complete` (or equivalent):
1. Scan remaining tasks in current milestone
2. Show confirmation prompt with task list
3. After user confirms, **implement ALL remaining tasks sequentially**
4. After each task: run full `@git.commit` subroutine (version bump, changelog, progress)
5. Display progress indicators between tasks
6. Continue until milestone complete or blocker encountered
7. Display summary report at end

**This is NOT a status command.** Do not confuse this with `/acp-status`. The purpose of `/acp-proceed` is to **DO WORK**, not report on work.

**Forbidden Behaviors** (all modes):
- Providing status summaries without implementation
- Asking about token limits or session size
- Suggesting to "continue later" or "push commits first"
- Ending with "ready to proceed" (you ARE proceeding!)

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] ACP installed in project
- [ ] `agent/progress.yaml` exists and has current task defined
- [ ] Current task document exists in `agent/tasks/`
- [ ] Context initialized (recommended to run `/acp-init` first)

---

## Steps (Single-Task Mode)

> **These steps apply when `/acp-proceed` is invoked WITHOUT autonomous arguments.**
> If autonomous mode was detected, skip to **Autonomous Mode** section below.

### 🚨 CRITICAL: These are IMPLEMENTATION steps, not planning steps

### 0. Display Command Header

Display the following informational header, then continue immediately:

```
⚡ /acp-proceed
  Implement tasks — single-task (default) or autonomous milestone completion (with arguments)

  Usage:
    /acp-proceed                                   Implement next task (single-task)
    /acp-proceed --complete                        Complete all remaining tasks
    /acp-proceed --turbo                           Autonomous, no confirm, contextual
    /acp-proceed --parallel --worktrees            Parallel sub-agents with worktrees
    /acp-proceed --dry-run                         Preview what would be done

  Related:
    /acp-init      Load full project context first
    /acp-status    Check which task is current
    /acp-ci        Run /acp-ci --static after product/framework code changes
    @git.commit    Git commit (used per-task in autonomous)
```

### 1. Identify Current Task (30 seconds max)

**Actions**:
- Read `agent/progress.yaml`
- Find first task with status `in_progress` or `not_started` in the current milestone
- Read the task document

**🚨 MANDATORY STATUS UPDATES (do these NOW, not later):**
- **Task status**: If task status is `not_started`, set it to `in_progress` in progress.yaml immediately
- **Task `started`**: If the task's `started` field is `null` or missing, set it to the current ISO 8601 timestamp (e.g., `2026-03-20T10:30:00Z`). Do NOT overwrite an existing `started` value.
- **Milestone status**: If the milestone's `status` is `not_started`, set it to `in_progress` immediately
- **Milestone `started`**: If the milestone's `started` field is `null` or missing, set it to today's date (e.g., `2026-03-20`). Do NOT overwrite an existing `started` value.

These updates MUST be written to progress.yaml before moving to Step 2. Do not defer them.

**Driver delegation** (when `agent/driver.yaml` present):

> This section is a no-op if `agent/driver.yaml` does not exist.

- Before invoking `git` operations, check `driver_is_native git` (source `agent/scripts/acp.driver-yaml.sh` first)
- If not native, delegate to the configured backend via `driver_query git server` / `driver_query git method`
- If `--verbose` flag is set, log the delegation decision: "Delegating git → [type] [server]::[method]"

**DO NOT spend time analyzing or planning. MOVE TO STEP 2 IMMEDIATELY.**

### 1.5. Read Contextual Key Files

Before implementing, load relevant key files from the index.

**Actions**:
- Check if `agent/index/` directory exists
- If exists, scan for all `*.yaml` files (excluding `*.template.yaml`)
- Parse entries, merge across namespaces (`local.*` takes precedence)
- Filter entries where `applies` includes `acp.proceed`
- Sort by weight descending
- Read matching files
- Produce visible output

**Display format**:
```
📑 Reading Key Files & Context (acp.proceed)...
  ✓ agent/patterns/bootstrap.template.md (weight: 0.8, pattern)
  ✓ agent/design/acp-commands-design.md (weight: 0.7, design)
  📝 "Migration files MUST be numbered sequentia..." (weight: 1.0, note)
  ⚡ "Never modify files in src/legacy/ without..." (weight: 0.9, directive)

  2 files read, 2 inline entries loaded
```

**Inline entries** (`path: null`): Display truncated description in quotes. Use 📝 for `kind: note`, ⚡ for `kind: directive`.

**Note**: If `agent/index/` does not exist, skip silently. Do NOT spend excessive time here — read files quickly and move to implementation.  

### 1.6. Review Relevant Patterns

Scan patterns relevant to the current task before implementing.

**Actions**:
- Check if `agent/patterns/` directory exists
- If it exists, list all pattern files
- Read patterns directly relevant to the task objective:
  - Patterns mentioned in the task document
  - Patterns related to the implementation domain (e.g. bash scripting, YAML, testing)
  - Up to 2-3 most relevant patterns
- Note conventions to follow during implementation

**DO NOT spend excessive time. Read only directly relevant patterns. If no patterns are relevant, skip silently.**  

### 1.7. Load Design Context

Load the design document for supplementary implementation context.

**Actions**:
- Check the current task file's metadata for the **Design Reference** field
  - If field contains a markdown link (e.g., `[Design Name](../design/local.feature.md)`): Extract the path and read that design document
  - If field is `None`: Invoke `/acp-design-reference` directive ([`agent/commands/acp.design-reference.md`](acp.design-reference.md)) to dynamically search by topic keywords from the task name and milestone
  - If field is missing (older task without the field): Invoke `/acp-design-reference` directive to dynamically search
- If a design document was found, read it and note key sections: Solution, Implementation, Key Design Decisions, Trade-offs
- Hold this context for use during implementation

**Display**:

When design loaded:
```
Design Context: Loaded local.design-reference-system.md
  Sections: Solution, Implementation, Key Design Decisions, Trade-offs
  Use as supplementary context during implementation.
```

When no design found:
```
Design Context: No design document found for this task.
  Implementing from task file only.
```

**Usage during implementation**: The design context informs implementation decisions when:  
- The task step is ambiguous about approach
- An edge case arises not explicitly covered in the task
- The agent needs to understand "why" a particular approach was chosen
- Integration with other systems requires understanding the broader architecture

> **Note**: Tasks should be self-contained — an agent should be able to implement from the task alone. The design document provides supplementary "why" context and helps with edge cases not explicitly covered. If the task is missing critical implementation detail that exists in the design, that indicates a task creation gap (see `/acp-design-reference` directive for how task-create prevents this).

**Do NOT spend excessive time here — read quickly and move to implementation.**

### 2. START IMPLEMENTING NOW (This is the main step)

**🚨 MANDATORY ACTIONS - DO THESE IMMEDIATELY:**

- **Create files** that the task requires
- **Write code** specified in the task
- **Execute commands** needed for the task
- **Make changes** to existing files
- **Install dependencies** if needed
- **Run tests** if specified
- **Verify functionality** as you go

**DO NOT**:
- ❌ Provide summaries of what you "will" do
- ❌ Ask if the user wants to proceed
- ❌ Mention token limits, costs, or session size
- ❌ Suggest breaking the task into smaller pieces
- ❌ End with "ready to implement" or similar

**YOU ARE IMPLEMENTING. START NOW. NO EXCUSES.**

### 3. Complete the Task or Make Substantial Progress

**Keep working until**:
- ✅ Task is complete, OR
- ✅ You've made substantial progress (50%+ of task done), OR
- ✅ You encounter a genuine blocker that requires user input

**"Substantial progress" means**:
- Multiple files created/modified
- Core functionality implemented
- Verification steps passing
- Clear advancement toward task completion

**NOT substantial**:
- Reading files
- Planning what to do
- Providing status updates
- Asking questions that could be answered by reading docs

### 3.5. Verify All Deliverables Exist (Post-Completion Audit)

**Before marking a task complete, you MUST verify every expected deliverable. Sub-agents always say they are done. The orchestrator must mechanically verify that they actually are.**

**CI gate (M86):** If the task touched product or framework code (scripts, commands, schemas, workflows, packages), run `bash agent/scripts/acp.ci.sh --static` (or `/acp-ci --static`) and require green **before** marking complete. Do **not** require `--full` / matrix E2E in proceed by default — that is opt-in local CI parity.

This step is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Run it whether you implemented the task yourself (Single-Task Mode) or a sub-agent reported completion (Autonomous/Parallel Mode). In either case, trust nothing: re-read the task doc and check every claim against reality.

#### Step A — Re-read the task document

Load the full task file fresh from disk. Do not rely on memory of what the task said. Specifically re-read:
- `Objective` and `Context` (to remind yourself what the task is supposed to accomplish)
- `Expected Output` — `Files Created`, `Files Modified`
- `Verification` checklist
- `User-Observable Acceptance` (REQUIRED section in every task)
- `Spec Coverage` (present only when a spec applies)

#### Step B — Mechanical file checks

For every entry in `Files Created`:
- Confirm the file exists on disk (`ls`, `stat`, or Read tool).
- If the task specified exact content (schemas, README sections, config shape), confirm that content is present.

For every entry in `Files Modified`:
- Confirm the file exists.
- Confirm `git diff` shows the expected changes.
- For modifications that are claimed to be additive (new function, new section), confirm the new content is present.

Any file that is missing or empty is a HARD FAILURE — halt immediately.

#### Step C — Walk the `Verification` checklist

For each checkbox in the Verification section, evaluate whether the claim holds:
- File-existence claims → `ls`/`stat` (already done in Step B; cross-reference)
- Test claims ("all tests pass", "X new tests added") → run `npm test` / project equivalent and confirm the counts match
- Schema/DB claims → inspect the migration file or query the database
- Behavioral claims ("handler returns 400 on empty input") → inspect the code at the claimed location
- Integration claims ("tool registered in X") → grep for the registration

Do NOT mechanically check boxes without verifying the underlying claim. A checked box that fails verification is drift.

#### Step D — Audit `User-Observable Acceptance`

This section is required in every task. It describes what a user can observe after the task is done.

For each criterion:
- **UI claims** → `grep` the client files for the rendered text/component/label. If the claim is "hover shows popover with CEFR badge", confirm a `word-popover-cefr` class exists in the rendered output.
- **API claims** → construct a mental `curl`. If the claim is "GET /api/word returns JSON with `gloss` field", verify the handler returns that shape.
- **DB claims** → confirm the table/column exists and that writing to it works.
- **File claims** → confirm the file exists with the specified content (Step B already covers this).

If the task has `N/A — <reason>` instead of acceptance criteria, verify the justification is at least 10 characters and is coherent. If a feature task tries to escape with `N/A`, reject it — the task has an observable effect; go find it.

An unverifiable acceptance claim is drift. Log it.

#### Step E — Audit `Spec Coverage` (when present)

For each `R<N>` requirement claimed:
- Find where it is implemented. This is typically code (a function, a handler, a schema) and optionally a test.
- Verify the implementation actually satisfies the requirement's MUST/SHOULD/MAY language. If R10 says "MUST create a user_pen_pals row on Tier 2 quest completion", confirm that row creation actually happens in the code path.
- For each `Covered behaviors` test case, confirm the test file exists and actually runs the specified scenario.

If a claimed R<N> has no implementation, that is drift. If a test case is missing, that is drift.

#### Step F — Produce the traceability table

Emit a written report showing coverage at a glance:

```
Task: task-<N>-<name>.md
Deliverables: X/Y files present
Verification: X/Y checklist items pass
User-Observable Acceptance: X/Y criteria verified
Spec Coverage (R<range>): X/Y requirements implemented

Drift detected:
  ⚠️ R12 → claimed but implementation missing letter frequency enforcement
  ❌ "Help button visible in character conversation" → no evidence in client code
```

Any ✗ / ❌ / ⚠️ items must be resolved before the task is marked complete.

#### Step G — Decide

- **All checks pass** → proceed to Step 4 (Update Progress Tracking), mark task complete.
- **Drift detected, fixable** → do the following in order (do NOT skip straight to a fix):
  1. **Update the task document** to record the drift verbatim. Add a `## Drift Remediation` section to the task doc listing each drifted item (unchecked checklist items, unmet acceptance criteria, missing spec requirements). This makes the drift a first-class durable artifact, not a memory hole.
  2. **Spawn a mandatory remediation sub-agent** with a precise scope. The sub-agent's brief must (a) paste the `## Drift Remediation` section verbatim as its task list, (b) state that the sub-agent must NOT mark complete until every drift item is resolved, (c) require the sub-agent to re-run its own Step 3.5 audit before reporting done. If the current LLM provider does not support sub-agents, halt instead and ask the user to spawn one manually — do NOT fix drift inline in the orchestrator loop.
  3. **Re-run this entire Step 3.5 audit** on the task after the sub-agent reports done. The orchestrator still does not trust the sub-agent's "done" — audit again from scratch.
- **Drift detected, deferred** → if the user has explicitly agreed to defer specific items to a later milestone, update the task to record those deferrals verbatim (with target milestone) before marking complete. Do NOT silently mark drift as done.
- **Drift that shouldn't be deferred** → HALT. Present the traceability table to the user. Ask for guidance.

**Forbidden shortcuts:**
- Do NOT trust a sub-agent's "done" report without this audit.
- Do NOT check the `Verification` boxes without verifying the underlying claims.
- Do NOT skip `User-Observable Acceptance` — every task has it.
- Do NOT skip `Spec Coverage` when it's present.
- Do NOT mark a task complete with outstanding drift.

A task with passing tests but a missing user-observable outcome is NOT complete. A task with satisfied verification but unmet spec requirements is NOT complete. "Sub-agent said done" is not complete.

### 4. Update Progress Tracking

**Only after verifying all deliverables**, update `agent/progress.yaml`:

**🚨 MANDATORY TASK UPDATES:**
- Mark task `status` as `completed` (if done) or leave as `in_progress` (if partial)
- **Set `completed_date`** to the current ISO 8601 timestamp (e.g., `2026-03-20T14:45:00Z`). This is MANDATORY for completed tasks.
- **Set `completed:` in the task file's YAML frontmatter** to today's ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). This field is the task-file-level status indicator — leave blank for in-progress tasks. Only applies to task files that have a YAML `---` frontmatter block (M20+ format); skip silently for legacy task files that use `**Status**:` prose fields.
- **Auto-compute `actual_hours`**: If both `started` and `completed_date` are set, calculate `actual_hours = (completed_date - started)` in hours, rounded to 1 decimal place. If `started` is missing, set `actual_hours` to `null`.
- Increment `tasks_completed` on the milestone

**🚨 MANDATORY MILESTONE UPDATES:**
- Update milestone `progress` percentage: `(tasks_completed / tasks_total) * 100`
- **If this was the LAST task in the milestone** (all tasks now completed):
  - Set milestone `status` to `completed`
  - Set milestone `completed` to today's date (e.g., `2026-03-20`)
  - Set milestone `progress` to `100`
  - Update `current_milestone` to the next incomplete milestone (if any)

**Additional updates:**
- Add `recent_work` entry describing what was IMPLEMENTED
- Update `next_steps`

**Do NOT skip timestamp or status updates. Every completed task MUST have a `completed_date`. Every completed milestone MUST have a `completed` date.**

### 5. Report What Was IMPLEMENTED (Not What Will Be Done)

**Provide a completion report showing**:
- What files were created/modified
- What functionality was implemented
- What verification steps passed
- What remains (if task incomplete)

**DO NOT**:
- ❌ End with "ready to continue"
- ❌ Ask if user wants to proceed
- ❌ Suggest next steps without implementing them

---

## Autonomous Mode

> **These steps apply when `/acp-proceed` is invoked WITH `--complete`, `--auto`, `--autonomous`, `--finish-milestone`, or natural language indicating autonomous completion.**
>
> **🚨 CRITICAL**: Do NOT start implementing tasks until the user confirms the plan.

### A1. Scan Remaining Tasks

**Actions**:
- Read `agent/progress.yaml`
- Identify the current milestone (from `current_milestone` field)
- Collect all tasks in that milestone with status `not_started` or `in_progress`
- Read each task document to understand scope
- Order tasks based on: progress.yaml order, next steps, previously defined priorities, and chat context

**Task selection is NOT strictly lowest-ID-first.** Use judgment based on:
- Dependencies between tasks
- Progress.yaml ordering and notes
- Previously defined priorities in milestone or task documents
- Current chat context (user may have indicated preferences)

### A2. Show Confirmation Prompt

**🚨 MANDATORY**: Always show this confirmation before starting autonomous execution. Never skip this step.  

Display the following to the user:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Autonomous Completion Mode
  M{X} - {Milestone Name}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  {N} remaining tasks:

    1. Task {id}: {name} ({estimated_hours})
    2. Task {id}: {name} ({estimated_hours})
    3. Task {id}: {name} ({estimated_hours})
    ...

  After each task:
    - Update progress.yaml, CHANGELOG.md, AGENT.md version
    - Run @git.commit (full subroutine)
    - Display progress bar

  At end of run:
    - Summary report with completion stats
    - Push NOT automatic (you decide when to push)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Proceed? (yes/no)
```

**Wait for user confirmation.** If user says no, exit autonomous mode and fall back to single-task mode or stop.

### A3. Autonomous Task Loop

After user confirms, execute the following loop:

```
FOR each remaining task in planned order:

  1. DISPLAY progress indicator (see A5)

  2. READ task document, key files, and design context
     - Re-read progress.yaml at start of each iteration (context freshness)
     - Set task `status` to `in_progress` and set task `started` timestamp if null — IMMEDIATELY
     - If milestone `status` is `not_started`, set it to `in_progress` and set milestone `started` to today's date — IMMEDIATELY
     - Write these updates to progress.yaml NOW before continuing
     - Read contextual key files from agent/index/ (filter by acp.proceed applies)
     - Read the task file
     - Load design context: If task has Design Reference field with a link, read that
       design document. If field is "None" or missing, skip dynamic search in autonomous
       mode (to conserve context window). Use explicit link only.

  3. IMPLEMENT the task
     - Follow the same implementation approach as Single-Task Steps 2-3
     - Create files, write code, execute commands
     - Run tests if specified in task
     - Complete the task fully

  4. VERIFY DELIVERABLES
     - Re-read the task's "Expected Output" and "Verification" sections
     - Confirm every file in "Files Created" exists on disk
     - Confirm every file in "Files Modified" has the expected changes
     - Walk each verification checkbox and confirm it passes
     - If anything is missing: create it before proceeding
     - Do NOT skip this step — a task with passing tests but missing files is NOT complete

  5. CHECK for failure
     - If task fails or encounters blocker → HALT (see A8)
     - If E2E tests fail → HALT (see A8)
     - Do NOT commit partial work

  6. UPDATE progress tracking (🚨 ALL fields mandatory — do not skip any)
     - Mark task `status` as `completed`
     - Set `completed_date` to current ISO 8601 timestamp — MANDATORY
     - **Set `completed:` in the task file's YAML frontmatter** to today's ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Skip silently for legacy task files without a `---` frontmatter block.
     - If `started` is `null` or missing, set `started` to current timestamp (same as completed_date)
     - Auto-compute `actual_hours` from `(completed_date - started)` in hours
     - Increment milestone `tasks_completed`
     - Update milestone `progress` percentage: `(tasks_completed / tasks_total) * 100`
     - If this was the LAST task: set milestone `status` to `completed`, set milestone `completed` to today's date, update `current_milestone` to next incomplete milestone
     - Add recent_work entry

  7. RUN @git.commit subroutine
     - Determine version bump (patch for most tasks, minor for features)
     - Update AGENT.md version
     - Update CHANGELOG.md with task completion entry
     - Stage all relevant files
     - Create commit with conventional commit message
     - Do NOT push (push only at end of entire run)

  8. CONTINUE to next task

END FOR
```

### A3.1. Parallel Task Decomposition (v6.8.2, R9)

When the current task has `task_type: parallel` or `task_type: orchestrator-workers`:

1. **Read sub_tasks from route file** — parse the `sub_tasks:` array
2. **Resolve dependency DAG**:
   - Sub-tasks with `depends_on: []` → spawn immediately (concurrent)
   - Sub-tasks with `depends_on: [route-NNN]` → wait for dependency to complete
3. **Spawn sub-agents**: For each ready sub-task, spawn a sub-agent with the sub-task context. Use the sub-task's `executor` field (defaults to parent's `sub_task_default_executor`).
4. **Wait for completion**: Poll sub-agents until all complete.
5. **Aggregate outputs**: Collect all sub-task outputs. Verify all deliverables exist.
6. **Mark parent complete**: Set `completed:` on the parent route file.

**Dependency validation** (in `scripts/acp-validate.ts`):
- All `depends_on` values must reference existing sub-task IDs
- No circular dependencies (DFS detection)
- At least one sub-task must have `depends_on: []`

### A3.5. Milestone Completion Sweep

**After ALL tasks in the autonomous loop are done, perform a final deliverables audit:**

1. **Re-read each completed task's Expected Output section**
2. **Verify all files exist** — ls/stat every file listed across all tasks
3. **Run the full test suite** one final time
4. **Check for common omissions:**
   - README.md or project documentation
   - Configuration files (.env.example, etc.)
   - Architecture/design documentation if specified
   - Migration guides if specified

**If any deliverable from any task is missing:**
- Create it before generating the Summary Report
- Re-run verification for the affected task
- Only proceed to Summary Report when all tasks' deliverables are confirmed

This sweep catches files that may have been missed during individual task execution, especially documentation artifacts that are easy to overlook during coding-heavy milestones.

### A4. Per-Task Git Commit

After each successfully completed task, run the full `@git.commit` subroutine:

1. **Analyze changes** — determine version impact (usually patch for individual tasks)
2. **Bump version** — update AGENT.md version field
3. **Update CHANGELOG.md** — add entry describing task completion
4. **Stage files** — all files modified during the task + version files + progress.yaml
5. **Commit** — conventional commit message referencing the task
6. **Do NOT push** — commits accumulate locally; push only at end of run

**Commit message format**:
```
{type}({scope}): {task description}

Completed Task {N}: {task name}
- {change 1}
- {change 2}

Milestone: M{X} - {milestone name} ({completed}/{total} tasks)
Version: {new version}
```

### A5. Progress Indicators

Between each task, display a visual progress update:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ████████████░░░░░░░░ {completed}/{total} tasks ({percent}%)

  ✅ Task {id}: {name}
  ✅ Task {id}: {name}
  ✅ Task {id}: {name}
  ⏳ Task {id}: {name}            ← current
  ⬚  Task {id}: {name}
  ⬚  Task {id}: {name}

  Commits: {N} (not pushed)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Symbols**:
- ✅ = completed
- ⏳ = in progress (about to start)
- ⬚ = pending
- ❌ = failed

### A6. Summary Report

At the end of the autonomous run (whether all tasks complete or halted), display:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Autonomous Run Complete — M{X}: {Milestone Name}
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Progress: ████████████████░░░░ {completed}/{total} ({percent}%)

  ✅ Completed ({N}):
     • Task {id}: {name}
     • Task {id}: {name}
     • Task {id}: {name}

  ❌ Failed ({N}):                          ← only if failures
     • Task {id}: {name} — {reason}

  ⬚  Remaining ({N}):                      ← only if incomplete
     • Task {id}: {name}

  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  Commits:   {N} (not pushed)
  Version:   {old} → {new}
  ─────────────────────────────────────────

  Next steps:
    • git push                    ← push all commits
    • /acp-proceed                ← continue remaining tasks
    • /acp-status                 ← review project status

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### A7. Dry-Run Mode

When `--dry-run` is specified (alone or with `--complete`):

1. Scan remaining tasks (same as A1)
2. Display the confirmation prompt (same as A2) but with a `(DRY RUN)` label
3. **Do NOT execute any tasks**
4. Display what would happen:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  DRY RUN — Autonomous Completion Preview
  M{X} - {Milestone Name}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Would complete {N} tasks:

    1. Task {id}: {name} ({hours}h)
    2. Task {id}: {name} ({hours}h)
    3. Task {id}: {name} ({hours}h)

  Would create {N} commits (1 per task)
  Would bump version {N} times

  (dry run — no files were modified)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

5. Exit without making any changes

### A8. Error Handling & Halting

**When to HALT autonomous execution:**

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Task fails partway through | HALT. Do NOT commit partial work. Seek user input. |
| E2E tests fail | HALT. Require user intervention guidance. |
| Blocker requiring user decision | HALT. Present the blocker and ask for guidance. |
| Agent cannot make a decision | HALT. Ask user for input. |
| Git commit fails | HALT. Seek user intervention. |

**On HALT**:
1. Stop the autonomous loop
2. Display the summary report (A6) showing what was completed before the halt
3. Clearly explain the failure:
   ```
   ⚠️  Autonomous run halted at Task {id}: {name}

   Reason: {clear explanation of what went wrong}

   What was completed before halt:
     ✅ Task {id}: {name} (committed)
     ✅ Task {id}: {name} (committed)

   Uncommitted work:
     ⚠️  Task {id}: {name} — partial, NOT committed

   Awaiting your guidance to continue.
   ```
4. Wait for user to provide guidance before continuing

**NEVER**:
- ❌ Skip a failed task and move to the next one
- ❌ Commit partial work from a failed task
- ❌ Retry a failed task without user guidance
- ❌ Auto-resolve errors by discarding changes

### A9. Interruption Handling

If the user sends a message during autonomous execution:

- **Infer user intent** from the message content
- If the user is providing guidance or a correction → incorporate it and continue
- If the user wants to stop → halt gracefully (show summary report)
- If unclear → ask the user what they'd like to do
- **Never ignore user messages** during autonomous execution

### A10. Worktree Merge Gating (`--noworktreemerge` / `--safe`)

When `--noworktreemerge` (or any alias: `--holdmerge`, `--safemerge`, `--safe`) is active, the agent **does NOT auto-merge worktrees** when sub-agents complete. Instead, it queues completed worktrees and prompts the user before each merge.

**Why this exists**: When multiple Claude CLI instances run `--yolo --worktrees` in parallel across overlapping feature areas, concurrent worktree merges create destructive conflicts. Git worktree merges involve intensive, relatively destructive commands — two inflight merges will constantly collide, produce spurious merge conflicts, and leave each agent seeing state that is inconsistent with its context. `--safe` ensures only one merge happens at a time, controlled by the user.

**Behavior**:

1. **Sub-agents work normally** on their worktrees — no change to task execution
2. **When a sub-agent completes**, instead of immediately merging:
   - Mark the worktree as `merge-ready` in the agent's internal tracking
   - Display a notification:
     ```
     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
       Worktree ready to merge (--safe mode)

       Task {id}: {name}
       Branch: {worktree-branch}
       Files changed: {N}

       Other agents may be running. Merge when ready:
         → Reply "merge" to merge this worktree now
         → Reply "merge all" to merge all ready worktrees
         → Reply "skip" to defer this merge

       Pending merges: {N} ready, {N} still running
     ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
     ```
3. **Wait for user permission** before executing any merge
4. **On "merge"**: Execute the worktree merge for the specified task, then report result
5. **On "merge all"**: Merge all `merge-ready` worktrees sequentially (one at a time, in completion order)
6. **On "skip"**: Leave the worktree unmerged; user can merge manually or later

**Without `--safe`** (default `--parallel --worktrees` behavior): worktrees auto-merge as soon as each sub-agent completes. This is fine when only one agent is running, but risky with concurrent agents.

**Without `--worktrees`** (default): `--parallel` runs sub-agents in the same working directory without worktrees. This is simpler and avoids merge complexity, but sub-agents may conflict with each other on file writes.

**`--safe` does NOT change**:
- How sub-agents are spawned or how they work
- The task loop, commit flow, or progress tracking
- The confirmation prompt (A2) or summary report (A6)

**`--safe` only gates the final worktree-to-main merge step.**

### A11. Stacked Worktree Mode (`--stacked`)

When `--stacked` is active, the agent completes the entire milestone using a chain of stacked worktrees. Each task branches from the previous task's worktree, building up changes incrementally. **Nothing merges to main until the full stack is complete and the user approves.**

**What `--stacked` implies**: `--complete` (full milestone) + `--worktrees` (isolation). You cannot use `--stacked` with `--parallel` (stacked is inherently sequential; `--dag`/`--graph` will add parallel-within-stack in the future).

**Why this exists**: Stacked mode lets the user proof the entire milestone's work before it touches main. Each task gets its own atomic commit, the worktree chain preserves full history, and the user has a single approval gate before anything lands.

#### Worktree Chain Structure

```
main (untouched)
 └─ acp/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{id-1}     ← Task 1 branches from main
     └─ acp/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{id-2}  ← Task 2 branches from Task 1
         └─ acp/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{id-3}  ← Task 3 branches from Task 2
             └─ ...
```

**Branch naming**: `acp/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{id}` (e.g., `acp/stack/m6-preferences/task-37`)

**Worktree directory**: `.claude/worktrees/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{id}/`

#### Stacked Task Loop

```
1. SCAN remaining tasks in current milestone (same as A1)

2. SHOW confirmation prompt (same as A2, with "Stacked Worktree Mode" label)
   - If --yolo, skip confirmation

3. CREATE first worktree branching from current branch:
   - git worktree add .claude/worktrees/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{id-1} -b acp/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{id-1}

4. FOR each remaining task in planned order:

   a. If this is NOT the first task:
      - CREATE worktree branching from the PREVIOUS task's branch:
        git worktree add .claude/worktrees/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{id-N} -b acp/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{id-N} acp/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{id-N-1}

   b. IMPLEMENT the task in its worktree
      - Same implementation approach as A3 steps 2-4 (implement, verify, check failure)
      - All file operations happen in the worktree directory

   c. RUN @git.commit in the worktree
      - Version bump, changelog, progress updates — identical to normal autonomous mode
      - Commit lands on the task's branch within the worktree

   d. DISPLAY progress indicator (same as A5, with "stacked" label)

   e. CONTINUE to next task

END FOR
```

#### Final Merge Approval

After all tasks complete, the tip of the stack (last task's branch) contains the cumulative result of the entire milestone.

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Stacked Worktree Mode — Stack Complete

  M{X}: {Milestone Name}
  Tasks completed: {N}/{N}
  Commits: {N} (on stacked branches, not on main)

  Stack tip: acp/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{last-id}
  Worktree: .claude/worktrees/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{last-id}/

  Main branch is untouched. To land these changes:
    → Reply "merge" to merge the stack into main
    → Reply "diff" to review the cumulative diff first
    → Reply "abort" to discard the entire stack

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**On "merge"**: Merge the tip-of-stack branch into main (regular merge, preserving all per-task atomic commits). Then clean up all stacked worktrees and branches.

**On "diff"**: Show `git diff main...acp/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{last-id}` so the user can review the full cumulative change. Then re-prompt for merge/abort.

**On "abort"**: Remove all stacked worktrees and delete all stacked branches. Main is untouched.

#### Cleanup

After a successful merge to main:
1. Remove all worktree directories: `git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{id}` for each task
2. Delete all stacked branches: `git branch -d acp/stack/{milestone-slug}/task-{id}` for each task
3. Report cleanup complete

#### Failure Handling

If a task fails mid-stack:
1. **HALT** — do not continue to the next task
2. **Preserve the entire worktree chain** — do not clean up
3. Display the summary report (A6) with stacked context:
   ```
   ⚠️  Stacked run halted at Task {id}: {name}

   Reason: {clear explanation}

   Completed in stack (not on main):
     ✅ Task {id}: {name} — acp/stack/{slug}/task-{id}
     ✅ Task {id}: {name} — acp/stack/{slug}/task-{id}

   Failed:
     ❌ Task {id}: {name} — .claude/worktrees/stack/{slug}/task-{id}/

   The worktree chain is preserved. You can:
     → Inspect the failed worktree at the path above
     → Reply "resume" to retry the failed task
     → Reply "abort" to discard the entire stack
   ```
4. Wait for user guidance

## Examples

### Example 1: Single-Task (Default)

**Context**: You want to implement the next task  

**Invocation**: `/acp-proceed`  

**Result**: Identifies next task, immediately starts implementing, completes task, updates progress  

### Example 2: Autonomous Completion with Flags

**Context**: Milestone has 5 remaining tasks, you want them all done  

**Invocation**: `/acp-proceed --complete`  

**Result**: Shows confirmation with 5 tasks listed, user confirms, agent implements all 5 tasks with per-task commits, displays summary  

### Example 3: Autonomous with Natural Language

**Context**: Same as above but using natural language  

**Invocation**: `/acp-proceed just finish everything`  

**Result**: Same as `--complete` — agent detects autonomous intent, shows confirmation, implements all tasks  

### Example 4: Dry-Run Preview

**Context**: You want to see what would be done without executing  

**Invocation**: `/acp-proceed --complete --dry-run`  

**Result**: Shows task list with estimates, exits without making changes  

### Example 5: Autonomous with Halt

**Context**: Milestone has 5 tasks, task 3 fails  

**Invocation**: `/acp-proceed --complete`  

**Result**: Completes tasks 1-2 with commits, halts at task 3, shows summary with 2 completed + 1 failed, waits for user guidance  

### Example 6: Single-Task with Commit

**Context**: You want to implement one task and commit

**Invocation**: `/acp-proceed --commit`

**Result**: Implements next task, runs `@git.commit` after completion

### Example 7: Yolo with Worktrees and Safe Merge (Multiple Agents)

**Context**: You have 3 Claude CLI instances working on different milestones. You want parallel worktree execution but need to control when merges happen to avoid collisions.

**Invocation**: `/acp-proceed --yolo --worktrees --safe`

**Result**: Sub-agents spin up on worktrees and work in parallel. When each finishes, instead of auto-merging, the agent notifies you and waits. You reply "merge" when no other agent is mid-merge, ensuring clean sequential merges.

### Example 8: Stacked Worktree Mode

**Context**: Milestone M6 has 8 tasks. You want the agent to complete them all, but nothing should touch main until you've reviewed the result.

**Invocation**: `/acp-proceed --stacked`

**Result**: Agent creates a chain of worktrees — Task 37 branches from main, Task 38 branches from Task 37, etc. Each task gets an atomic commit in its worktree. After all 8 tasks complete, the agent shows the stack summary and waits. You reply "diff" to review, then "merge" to land all 8 commits on main. Worktrees and branches are cleaned up automatically.

### Example 9: Stacked Yolo

**Context**: Same as above, but you trust the agent and don't need the confirmation prompt.

**Invocation**: `/acp-proceed --yolo --stacked`

**Result**: Skips confirmation, immediately starts the stacked worktree chain. Still waits for merge approval at the end — `--yolo` skips the start confirmation, not the final merge gate.

- [`/acp-init`](acp.init.md) - Use before proceeding to ensure full context loaded
- [`/acp-status`](acp.status.md) - Use to check which task is current before proceeding
- [`/acp-ci`](acp.ci.md) - Run `/acp-ci --static` before marking product/framework tasks complete
- [`/acp-update`](acp.update.md) - Use to manually update progress if needed
- [`/acp-sync`](acp.sync.md) - Use after completing tasks to sync documentation
- [`@git.commit`](git.commit.md) - Git commit subroutine (used per-task in autonomous mode)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: No current task found

**Symptom**: Error message "No current task identified"  

**Cause**: All tasks are completed or progress.yaml doesn't have a current task  

**Solution**: Review progress.yaml and either mark a task as `in_progress` or create new tasks for the next milestone  

### Issue 2: Task document not found

**Symptom**: Error message "Cannot read task file"  

**Cause**: Task file path in progress.yaml is incorrect or file doesn't exist  

**Solution**: Verify the file path in progress.yaml matches the actual task file location, or create the missing task document  

### Issue 3: Prerequisites not met

**Symptom**: Command reports missing prerequisites  

**Cause**: Task has dependencies that aren't satisfied yet  

**Solution**: Complete prerequisite tasks first, or resolve the dependencies, then run `/acp-proceed` again  

### Issue 4: Verification fails

**Symptom**: Some verification items don't pass  

**Cause**: Task steps weren't completed correctly or there are errors  

**Solution**: Review the failed verification items, fix issues, then re-run verification steps  

### Issue 5: Autonomous mode not detected

**Symptom**: Agent starts single-task mode despite passing `--complete`  

**Cause**: Arguments not parsed correctly or natural language not recognized  

**Solution**: Use explicit flag `--complete` instead of natural language. Ensure flag appears after `/acp-proceed`.  

### Issue 6: Context window exhaustion during autonomous run

**Symptom**: Agent loses context after completing several tasks  

**Cause**: Long autonomous runs consume context window  

**Solution**: Agent re-reads progress.yaml and task files at the start of each iteration to maintain context freshness. If context is truly exhausted, the run will halt and can be resumed with `/acp-proceed --complete` in a new session.

## Security Considerations

### File Access
- **Reads**: `agent/progress.yaml`, task documents, design documents, AGENT.md, CHANGELOG.md
- **Writes**: `agent/progress.yaml`, task-specific files, AGENT.md (version), CHANGELOG.md (entries)
- **Executes**: May execute commands as specified in task steps (e.g., `npm test`, `npm run build`), git commands for commits and worktree management (`git worktree add/remove`, `git branch -d`)

### Network Access
- **APIs**: May make API calls if task requires it
- **Repositories**: Interacts with git for commits (does NOT push in autonomous mode until end of run)

### Sensitive Data
- **Secrets**: Should not access secrets unless task explicitly requires configuration
- **Credentials**: Should not access credentials files

## Notes

- **Default behavior unchanged**: `/acp-proceed` without arguments works exactly as before (single-task)
- **`--complete` implies `--commit`**: There is no autonomous mode without per-task commits
- **Confirmation is mandatory**: Agent MUST show confirmation prompt before autonomous execution
- **No max task limit**: Agent runs until milestone complete or blocker encountered
- **Push only at end**: Commits accumulate locally; agent never pushes during autonomous run
- **Context freshness**: Agent re-reads progress.yaml at start of each task iteration
- **Interruption**: Agent infers user intent from any messages received during autonomous run
- **Error policy**: Halt on any failure, never commit partial work, always seek user guidance
- **`--stacked` mode**: Complete milestone in stacked worktrees — each task branches from the previous, nothing merges to main until user approves. Implies `--complete --worktrees`
- **`--stacked` is mutually exclusive with `--parallel`**: Stacked is sequential. Future `--dag`/`--graph` flags will add parallel-within-stack using plan dependencies
- Task execution may create, modify, or delete files as specified in task documents
- Use `/acp-status` first to see which task is current
- Update progress.yaml manually if command doesn't complete successfully
