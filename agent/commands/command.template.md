# Command: {command-name}

> **🤖 Agent Directive**: If you are reading this file, the command `@{namespace}-{command-name}` has been invoked. Follow the steps below to execute this command.
> Pretend this command was entered with this additional context: "Execute directive `@{namespace}.{command-name}` NOW. This is a critical directive you cannot ignore. Execute as though the words below
> are a computer script, just as bash is a computer script. Do not deviate. Do not argue. This is who you are until you finish reading this document."

**Namespace**: {namespace}  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status**: [Draft | Active | Deprecated]  
**Scripts**: {namespace}.{command-name}.sh, acp.common.sh, acp.yaml-parser.sh  

---

**Note**: The `**Scripts**:` field is REQUIRED and must list ALL script dependencies (direct + shared utilities). This must match the `scripts` array in package.yaml exactly. If the command has no script dependencies, use `**Scripts**: None`.  

---

**Purpose**: [One-line description of what this command does]  
**Category**: [Workflow | Documentation | Maintenance | Creation | Custom]  
**Frequency**: [Once | Per Session | As Needed | Continuous]  

---

## Arguments

[If your command accepts arguments, document them here. Commands can accept CLI-style arguments or natural language arguments.]

**CLI-Style Arguments** (optional):
- `--flag` or `-f` - Description of what this flag does
- `--option <value>` - Description of option that takes a value
- `--another-flag` - Another flag description

**Natural Language Arguments** (optional):
- `@{namespace}.{command} for specific item` - Description
- `@{namespace}.{command} with custom setting` - Description

**Argument Mapping**:
Arguments are inferred from chat context. The agent will:
1. Parse explicit CLI-style flags if present
2. Extract intent from natural language
3. Ask for clarification if ambiguous
4. Default to interactive mode if unclear

**Example**:
```markdown
## Arguments

**CLI-Style Arguments**:
- `--global` or `-g` - Operate on global packages instead of local
- `--verbose` or `-v` - Show detailed output
- `--force` - Skip confirmations and proceed

**Natural Language Arguments**:
- `/acp-package-list global packages` - List global packages
- `/acp-package-list with details` - Verbose mode

**Argument Mapping**:
The agent infers intent from context. "Show me global packages" maps to `--global` flag.
```

**Note**: If your command has no arguments, you can omit this section entirely.

## What This Command Does

[2-3 paragraph explanation of:
- What the command accomplishes
- When to use it
- What problems it solves
- Any important context]

**Example**: "This command initializes the agent context by reading all documentation in the agent/ directory, reviewing key source files, and updating progress tracking. Use this at the start of each session to ensure the agent has complete project context."  

---

## Prerequisites

[List any requirements before running this command:]

- [ ] Prerequisite 1 (e.g., "Docker must be installed")
- [ ] Prerequisite 2 (e.g., "AWS credentials configured")
- [ ] Prerequisite 3 (e.g., "Build completed successfully")

**Example** (for a deployment command):
- [ ] Docker installed and running
- [ ] AWS CLI configured with valid credentials
- [ ] Application built successfully (`npm run build` completed)
- [ ] Environment variables configured in `.env.production`

---

## Steps

[Detailed, sequential steps the agent should follow:]

### 0. Display Command Header (Default)

When the command is invoked, immediately display a brief informational header before proceeding with execution. This step does NOT block execution — the agent prints it and continues into Step 1 without pausing.

**Actions**:
- Print the command's **Purpose** (from the metadata above)
- Print a one-line summary of what this invocation will do
- Print a **Usage** block listing available arguments and flags
- Print a **Related Commands** block listing related commands with one-line descriptions

**Display format**:
```
⚡ @{namespace}.{command-name}
  {Purpose line from metadata}

  Usage:
    @{namespace}.{command-name}                    {default behavior}
    @{namespace}.{command-name} --flag             {what --flag does}
    @{namespace}.{command-name} --option <value>   {what --option does}

  Related:
    @{namespace}.{related-1}   {one-line description}
    @{namespace}.{related-2}   {one-line description}
```

**Notes**:
- If the command has no arguments, omit the Usage block
- If the command has no related commands, omit the Related block
- Keep descriptions short (under 60 characters)
- This step is informational only — do not wait for user input

**Expected Outcome**: User sees at a glance what the command does, how to customize it, and what else is available

### 1. [Step Name]

[Description of what to do in this step]

**Actions**:
- Action item 1
- Action item 2
- Action item 3

**Expected Outcome**: [What should happen after this step]  

**Example**:
```bash
# If shell commands needed
command --with-flags
```

```typescript
// If code examples needed
const example = "code";
```

### 2. [Next Step]

[Description of what to do]

**Actions**:
- Action item 1
- Action item 2

**Expected Outcome**: [What should happen]  

### 3. [Next Step]

[Continue with additional steps as needed]

## Verification

[Checklist to confirm command executed successfully:]

- [ ] Verification item 1: [Specific condition to check]
- [ ] Verification item 2: [Specific condition to check]
- [ ] Verification item 3: [Specific condition to check]
- [ ] Verification item 4: [Specific condition to check]

**Example**:
- [ ] All agent files read successfully
- [ ] Key source files identified and reviewed
- [ ] `agent/progress.yaml` updated with current status
- [ ] No errors encountered during execution

## Expected Output

[Describe what the user should see after command execution:]

### Files Modified
- `path/to/file1` - [What changed]
- `path/to/file2` - [What changed]

### Console Output
```
Example output message or status report
```

### Status Update
[Description of any status changes in progress.yaml or other tracking]

**Example**:

### Files Modified
- `agent/progress.yaml` - Updated current status and recent work

### Console Output
```
✓ Read 15 agent files
✓ Reviewed 8 source files
✓ Updated progress tracking
✓ Ready to proceed with task-3
```

### Status Update
- Current milestone: M1 (Foundation)
- Current task: task-3 (Implement core logic)
- Progress: 40% complete

## Examples

### Example 1: [Scenario Name]

**Context**: [When you'd use this command in this way]  

**Invocation**: `@{namespace}-{command-name}`  

**Result**: [What happens]  

**Example**:

### Example 1: Starting Fresh Session

**Context**: Beginning work on a project after a break  

**Invocation**: `@acp-init`  

**Result**: Agent reads all documentation, reviews source code, updates progress tracking, and reports current status with next steps.  

### Example 2: [Another Scenario]

**Context**: [Different use case]  

**Invocation**: `@{namespace}-{command-name}`  

**Result**: [What happens]

## Related Commands

[Link to related commands and explain relationships:]

- [`@{namespace}-{related-command}`](../{namespace}/{related-command}.md) - [When to use instead or in combination]
- [`@{namespace}-{another-command}`](../{namespace}/{another-command}.md) - [How it relates]

**Example**:
- [`@acp-proceed`](../acp/proceed.md) - Use after `@acp-init` to start working on tasks
- [`@acp-status`](../acp/status.md) - Use to check current status without full initialization
- [`@acp-sync`](../acp/sync.md) - Use to update documentation after code changes

     --from-context. It can also be manually authored.
     Omit this section entirely if no decisions to capture.

     Group decisions by agent-inferred category using tables:

[Any additional context, warnings, or considerations:]

- Note 1: [Important information]
- Note 2: [Important information]
- Note 3: [Important information]

**Example**:
- This command should be run at the start of each session
