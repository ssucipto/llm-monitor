**Category**: Creation  
**Frequency**: Once per project  

---

## What This Command Does

This command creates a new **generic ACP project** (not a package) with full ACP installation, project metadata, and git initialization. It's designed for creating applications, tools, or experiments that use ACP for development but aren't meant to be published as ACP packages.

**Key Features**:
- Creates projects in `~/.acp/projects/` (or custom location)
- Installs full ACP (all templates, commands, scripts)
- Creates project-focused README.md
- Initializes git repository
- Creates progress.yaml with project metadata
- **No package.yaml** (not a package)
- **No release branches** (not for distribution)
- **No pre-commit hooks** (no package.yaml to validate)
- **Uses `local` namespace** (not configurable)

**Use this when**: Starting a new application, tool, or experiment that will use ACP for development.

### 1. Collect Project Information

Gather project metadata via chat:

**Required Information**:
- **Project name** (kebab-case, will be directory name)
  - Ask: "What would you like to name your project? (lowercase, hyphens allowed)"
  - Example: "my-awesome-app", "task-manager", "ai-assistant"
  - Validation: lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens only
  
- **Project description** (one-line summary)
  - Ask: "Provide a one-line description of your project:"
  - Example: "A task management application with AI assistance"
  - Validation: Clear and concise

**Optional Information**:
- **Project type** (for context and README template)
  - Ask: "What type of project is this? (web-app, cli-tool, library, mcp-server, api, other)"
  - Default: "other" if not specified
  - Used for: README template selection, .gitignore patterns
  
- **Author name** (for documentation)
  - Ask: "What is your name (project author)? (optional, press Enter to skip)"
  - Example: "Patrick Michaelsen"
  
- **License** (default: MIT)
  - Ask: "What license would you like to use? (default: MIT)"
  - Common options: MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL-3.0, BSD-3-Clause
  - Default: MIT if not specified

- **Target directory** (default: ~/.acp/projects/{project-name})
  - Ask: "Where would you like to create the project? (default: ~/.acp/projects/{project-name})"
  - Supports: `~` expansion, `$HOME` expansion, relative paths, absolute paths
  - Default: `~/.acp/projects/{project-name}` if not specified

**Expected Outcome**: All project metadata collected  

### 2. Validate and Confirm

Show collected information and ask for confirmation:

**Actions**:
- Display summary of collected information
- Ask: "Does this look correct? (yes/no)"
- If no: Allow user to correct information
- If yes: Proceed to creation

**Expected Outcome**: User confirms project details  

### 3. Determine Target Directory

Calculate and validate target directory path:

**Actions**:
- Expand `~` to `$HOME` if present
- Expand `$HOME` to actual home directory
- Resolve relative paths from current directory
- Check if directory already exists
- If exists: Ask user to choose different name or confirm overwrite

**Expected Outcome**: Target directory path determined and validated  

### 4. Create Project Directory

Create the project directory:

**Actions**:
- Execute: `mkdir -p {target-directory}`
- Verify directory created successfully
- Report directory location

**Expected Outcome**: Empty project directory exists  

### 5. Install ACP

Run ACP installation in the new project directory:

**Actions**:
- Get path to current ACP installation: `./agent/scripts/acp.install.sh`
- Execute installation in new directory:
  ```bash
  cd {target-directory} && {path-to-acp}/agent/scripts/acp.install.sh
  ```
- Verify AGENT.md created
- Verify agent/ directory created with all subdirectories
- Verify all templates installed
- Verify all commands installed
- Verify all scripts installed

**Expected Outcome**: Full ACP installation in project directory  

### 6. Create Project README.md

Generate project-focused README with metadata:

**Actions**:
- Create README.md in project directory
- Fill in project name, description, type
- Include ACP attribution link
- Add development section with ACP commands
- Add license section
- Use project-type-specific template if available

**Template**:
```markdown

  ```yaml
  project:
    name: {project-name}
    version: 0.1.0
    started: {current-date}
    status: in_progress
    description: |

    implementation: 0
    overall: 0
  
  recent_work: []
  
  next_steps:
    - Define project requirements in agent/design/requirements.md
    - Plan milestones and tasks with /acp-plan
    - Start development with /acp-proceed
  
  notes: []
  
  current_blockers: []

## Related Commands

- [`/acp-package-create`](acp.package-create.md) - Create distributable ACP packages
- [`/acp-init`](acp.init.md) - Initialize context in created project
- [`/acp-plan`](acp.plan.md) - Plan milestones and tasks
- [`@git.init`](git.init.md) - Initialize git repository
- [`/acp-projects-restore`](acp.projects-restore.md) - Restore projects from git origins on new machines

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Directory already exists

**Symptom**: Error "Directory already exists"  

**Solution**: Choose a different project name, or remove existing directory, or confirm overwrite  

### Issue 2: Permission denied

**Symptom**: Error creating directory  

**Solution**: Check permissions for target location, or choose different location  

### Issue 3: ACP installation failed

**Symptom**: Error during ACP installation  

**Solution**: Verify you're in an ACP-installed directory, check internet connection, verify acp.install.sh exists  

### Issue 4: Git not installed

**Symptom**: Error "git: command not found"  

**Solution**: Install git from https://git-scm.com/downloads  

---

## Security Considerations

### File Access
- **Reads**: None (creates new files)
- **Writes**: Creates entire project directory structure
- **Executes**: `acp.install.sh`, `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`

### Network Access
- **APIs**: None
- **Repositories**: May clone ACP repository during installation

### Sensitive Data
- **Secrets**: Never include secrets in project files
- **Credentials**: Never commit credentials to git

---

## Notes

- Project name becomes directory name
- Projects always use `local` namespace (not configurable)
- No package.yaml created (projects aren't packages)
- No release branch configuration (not for distribution)
- No pre-commit hooks (no package.yaml to validate)
- README is project-focused (usage, development, deployment)
- Use `/acp-package-create` if you want to create a distributable package
- Projects can be created anywhere, not just ~/.acp/projects/
- Full ACP installation means all commands and templates are available
- progress.yaml starts empty (plan milestones with /acp-plan)
- After adding a git remote, run `/acp-projects-sync` to record `git_origin` in the registry for `/acp-projects-restore` support
