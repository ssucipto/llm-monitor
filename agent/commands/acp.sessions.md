**Status**: Active  
**Scripts**: acp.sessions.sh, acp.common.sh, acp.yaml-parser.sh

**Purpose**: Manage and view active agent sessions across projects  
**Category**: Workflow  
**Frequency**: As Needed

## Arguments

This command supports both CLI-style flags and natural language arguments.

**CLI-Style Arguments**:
- `list` (default) — list all active sessions
- `clean` — remove stale sessions (dead PIDs, timed out)
- `deregister` — end current session
- `count` — output number of active sessions
- `--project <name>` — filter by project name (used with `list`)
- `--id <session-id>` — target specific session (used with `deregister`)

**Natural Language Arguments**:
- "what's running?" → list
- "show remember-core" → list --project remember-core
- "stop my session" → deregister
- "clean up" → clean
- "how many sessions?" → count
- "what's active?" → list
- "end session" → deregister

**Argument Mapping**:
The agent infers intent from context:
1. Parse explicit CLI-style subcommands/flags if present
2. Extract intent from natural language keywords: `running`, `active`, `stop`, `end`, `clean`, `how many`, `count`
3. Project names after `show` or `for` map to `--project` filter
4. Default to `list` if no subcommand is detected

## What This Command Does

This command provides a user-friendly interface for managing agent sessions tracked in `~/.acp/sessions.yaml`. It wraps the `acp.sessions.sh` script subcommands with NLP argument parsing and formatted output.

Sessions are registered when `/acp-init` runs and deregistered when `/acp-report` runs. Between those, this command lets you see what's active, clean stale sessions, or manually end a session.

Use this command when you want to see what other agents are working on, check if stale sessions need cleanup, or manage your current session. The default behavior (`list`) always runs stale cleanup first to show accurate state.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] ACP installed in project
- [ ] `./agent/scripts/acp.sessions.sh` exists and is executable

## Steps

### 0. Display Command Header

Display the following informational header, then continue immediately:

```
⚡ /acp-sessions
  Manage and view active agent sessions across projects

  Usage:
    /acp-sessions                                  List all active sessions
    /acp-sessions clean                            Remove stale sessions
    /acp-sessions deregister                       End current session
    /acp-sessions count                            Output active session count
    /acp-sessions --project <name>                 Filter by project name

  Related:
    /acp-init      Registers session at start
    /acp-status    Shows session count in status
    /acp-report    Deregisters session at end
```

### 1. Parse Arguments

Determine the requested action from CLI flags or natural language.

**Actions**:
- Check for explicit subcommand: `list`, `clean`, `deregister`, `count`
- Check for `--project` and `--id` flags
- Apply natural language mapping if no explicit subcommand
- Default to `list` if no subcommand detected

**Expected Outcome**: Subcommand and options determined  

### 2. Run Stale Cleanup

Always clean stale sessions before displaying results.

**Actions**:
- Run `./agent/scripts/acp.sessions.sh clean` (silently, unless `clean` is the explicit subcommand)
- This removes sessions with dead PIDs or inactive for 2+ hours

**Expected Outcome**: Stale sessions removed  

### 2.5. Overlap Check (Advisory Only)

When the current agent has a declared `current_milestone` or `current_task` (from `/acp-init` context), check for concurrent sessions targeting the same work area.

**Actions**:
- Read `~/.acp/sessions.yaml`
- Filter sessions where ALL of these are true:
  - Session ID is NOT the current session
  - `status: active` OR `last_updated` is within the past 2 hours (recently active heuristic)
- For each qualifying foreign session, compare `current_milestone` with the current agent's milestone:
  - **Milestone match + task match** → emit strong warning:
    ```
    ⚠️  CONFLICT: Same Task Active in Another Session
    Session: <session-id> (started <time-ago>)
    Working on: task-<N> — <task title>

    Both sessions are targeting the same task. This will cause file conflicts.
    Recommended: coordinate before continuing.
      - Stop one session, or
      - Assign this session to a different task

    This is advisory only — you can continue, but conflicts are likely.
    ```
  - **Milestone match only** → emit moderate warning:
    ```
    ⚠️  Concurrent Session Detected
    Session: <session-id> (started <time-ago>)
    Working on: M<N> — <milestone name>

    Both sessions are targeting the same milestone. Coordinate to avoid conflicts:
      - Assign different tasks to each session, or
      - Stop one session before continuing

    This is advisory only — execution is not blocked.
    ```
  - **No match** → proceed silently
- Skip this check silently if: no `~/.acp/sessions.yaml` exists, no current milestone is declared, or the `list`/`count`/`clean` subcommand is the only intent (i.e. no active task context to compare)

**Expected Outcome**: User warned of concurrent overlap if present; execution continues regardless  

### 3. Execute Requested Subcommand

Run the appropriate `acp.sessions.sh` subcommand.

**Actions**:
- **list** (default): Run `./agent/scripts/acp.sessions.sh list [--project <name>]`
- **clean**: Run `./agent/scripts/acp.sessions.sh clean` (verbose output)
- **deregister**: Run `./agent/scripts/acp.sessions.sh deregister [--id <session-id>]`
- **count**: Run `./agent/scripts/acp.sessions.sh count`

**Expected Outcome**: Subcommand executed successfully  

### 4. Display Formatted Output

Present results in a clear format.

**List output**:
```
Active Sessions (3):

  sess_a1b2c3  remember-core
               Task 12: Implement Auth Middleware
               Started 45m ago, last active 2m ago

  sess_d4e5f6  agent-context-protocol  (this session)
               Task 91: Sessions Infrastructure
               Started 10m ago, last active now

  sess_g7h8i9  agentbase.me
               Task 5: Fix API Routes
               Started 1h ago, last active 20m ago
```

**Clean output**:
```
Cleaned 2 stale sessions:
  sess_x1y2z3  old-project (PID 12345 not running)
  sess_m4n5o6  test-project (inactive for 3h)

Active sessions remaining: 3
```

**Deregister output**:
```
Session sess_a1b2c3 deregistered.
Active sessions remaining: 2
```

**Count output**:
```
3
```

**Expected Outcome**: User sees formatted session information  

### 5. Suggest Next Actions

If relevant, suggest follow-up actions.

**Actions**:
- If sessions are stale: "Run `/acp-sessions clean` to remove stale sessions"
- If no sessions: "Run `/acp-init` to register a new session"
- If showing list: No suggestions needed (informational)

**Expected Outcome**: User knows what to do next (if applicable)

## Expected Output

### Files Modified
- `~/.acp/sessions.yaml` — updated by clean/deregister subcommands

### Console Output
See output formats in Step 4 above.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: List All Sessions (Default)

**Context**: You want to see what's currently running  

**Invocation**: `/acp-sessions`  

**Result**: Shows all active sessions with project, description, and timing info  

### Example 2: Filter by Project

**Context**: You want to see sessions for a specific project  

**Invocation**: `/acp-sessions --project remember-core`  

**Result**: Shows only sessions for remember-core  

### Example 3: Clean Stale Sessions

**Context**: You suspect some sessions are stale  

**Invocation**: `/acp-sessions clean`  

**Result**: Removes dead-PID and timed-out sessions, shows what was cleaned  

### Example 4: Natural Language Usage

**Context**: You want to check what's running using natural language  

**Invocation**: `/acp-sessions what's running?`  

**Result**: Same as `/acp-sessions list` — shows all active sessions  

### Example 5: End Current Session

**Context**: You're done working and want to deregister  

**Invocation**: `/acp-sessions stop my session`  

**Result**: Deregisters the current session, shows remaining count

## Related Commands

- [`/acp-init`](acp.init.md) — Registers session automatically at start
- [`/acp-status`](acp.status.md) — Shows session count in status output
- [`/acp-report`](acp.report.md) — Deregisters session automatically at end

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "acp.sessions.sh not found"

**Symptom**: Command reports script not found  

**Cause**: Sessions script not installed or path incorrect  

**Solution**: Verify `./agent/scripts/acp.sessions.sh` exists and is executable. Run `chmod +x agent/scripts/acp.sessions.sh` if needed.  

### Issue 2: Sessions disappear immediately

**Symptom**: Registered sessions are gone on next list  

**Cause**: Stale cleanup removing sessions because the registering process PID is dead  

**Solution**: Use `--pid <pid>` when registering to track the long-lived parent process (terminal/agent) instead of the script's own PID.  

### Issue 3: "No active sessions" when sessions should exist

**Symptom**: List shows no sessions despite recent registration  

**Cause**: Sessions were registered under a different process tree and stale cleanup removed them  

**Solution**: Re-register with `/acp-init` or manually via `./agent/scripts/acp.sessions.sh register --project <name> --pid <pid>`

## Security Considerations

### File Access
- **Reads**: `~/.acp/sessions.yaml`
- **Writes**: `~/.acp/sessions.yaml` (clean, deregister modify the file)
- **Executes**: `./agent/scripts/acp.sessions.sh`

### Network Access
- **APIs**: None
- **Repositories**: None

### Sensitive Data
- **Secrets**: Does not access secrets or credentials
- **Credentials**: Does not access credentials files
- **PIDs**: Stores process IDs for stale detection (not sensitive)

## Notes

- Mark current session with "(this session)" indicator in list output
- NLP parsing should be forgiving — "sessions", "what's active", "running" all map to list
- Always run `clean` before `list` to show accurate state
- Sessions are advisory only — no locking or coordination
- `~/.acp/sessions.yaml` is auto-created on first register
