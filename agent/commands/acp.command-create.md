## What This Command Does

This command creates a new command file with intelligent namespace handling, optional draft file support, and automatic updates to package.yaml and README.md. It provides a guided workflow for creating well-structured commands that follow ACP conventions.

**Key Features**:
- Context-aware (detects if in package vs project)
- Automatic namespace enforcement
- Draft file support with clarification workflow
- Auto-updates package.yaml and README.md
- Uses command.template.md as base
- Collects command-specific metadata (category, frequency)

**Use this when**: Creating a new command in an ACP project or package.  

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] ACP installed in current directory
- [ ] Command template exists (agent/commands/command.template.md)
- [ ] (Optional) Draft file prepared if using draft workflow

---

## Arguments

**Context Capture Arguments** (optional — passed to `/acp-clarification-capture` directive):

| Argument | Alias | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `--from-clarification <file>` | `--from-clar` | Capture decisions from a specific clarification file |
| `--from-clarifications` | `--from-clars` | Capture from all recent clarifications |
| `--from-chat-context` | `--from-chat` | Capture decisions from chat conversation |
| `--from-context` | (none) | Shorthand for all sources (clarifications + chat) |
| `--include-clarifications` | (none) | Alias for `--from-clars` |

**Default behavior** (no flags): Auto-detect clarifications and context in session.

## Steps

### 0. Display Command Header

```
⚡ /acp-command-create
  Create command files with namespace enforcement, draft support, and automatic package updates

  Usage:
    /acp-command-create                            Guided command creation
    /acp-command-create @my-draft.md               Create from draft file
    /acp-command-create --from-clar <file>         Capture from specific clarification
    /acp-command-create --from-context             Capture from all sources

  Related:
    /acp-pattern-create    Create patterns
    /acp-design-create     Create designs
    /acp-package-validate  Validate package after creation
```

This step is informational only — do not wait for user input.

### 1. Detect Context

Determine if in package or project directory:

**Actions**:
- Check if package.yaml exists
- If package: Infer namespace from package.yaml, directory, or git remote
- If project: Use "local" namespace

**Expected Outcome**: Context detected, namespace determined  

### 2. Check for Draft File

Check if draft file was provided as argument:

**Syntax**:
- `/acp-command-create @my-draft.md` (@ reference)
- `/acp-command-create agent/drafts/my-draft.md` (path)
- `/acp-command-create` (no draft)

**Actions**:
- If draft provided: Read draft file
- If no draft: Proceed to Step 3

**Expected Outcome**: Draft file read (if provided)  

### 2.5. Read Contextual Key Files

Before creating content, load relevant key files from the index.

**Actions**:
- Check if `agent/index/` directory exists
- If exists, scan for all `*.yaml` files (excluding `*.template.yaml`)
- Filter entries where `applies` includes `acp.command-create`
- Sort by weight descending, read matching files
- Produce visible output

**Note**: If `agent/index/` does not exist, skip silently.  

### 2.7. Capture Clarification Context

Invoke the `/acp-clarification-capture` shared directive to capture decisions from clarifications and/or chat context.

**Actions**:
- Read and follow the directive in [`agent/commands/acp.clarification-capture.md`](acp.clarification-capture.md)
- Pass through any `--from-*` arguments from this command's invocation
- If no `--from-*` flags specified: auto-detect clarifications in session (default behavior)
- If uncaptured clarifications detected, show warning and ask user whether to include
- Directive returns a "Key Design Decisions" markdown section (or nothing if no context)
- Hold the generated section for insertion during Step 5 (Generate Command File)

**Expected Outcome**: Key Design Decisions section generated (if context available), or skipped cleanly  

### 3. Collect Command Information

Gather information from user via chat:

**Information to Collect**:
- **Command name** (without namespace prefix)
  - Example: "deploy" (not "firebase.deploy")
  - Validation: lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens
- **Command description** (one-line summary)
  - Example: "Deploy Firebase functions to production"
- **Command category**:
  - Workflow
  - Documentation
  - Maintenance
  - Creation
  - Custom
- **Command frequency**:
  - Once
  - Per Session
  - As Needed
  - Continuous
- **Command arguments** (optional):
  - Ask: "Does this command accept arguments? (yes/no)"
  - If yes: Collect CLI-style flags and natural language mappings
  - If no: Skip Arguments section in generated command
- **Command version** (default: 1.0.0)

**If no draft provided**:
- Ask: "Describe what you want this command to accomplish" OR
- Offer: "Would you like to create an empty draft file first?"

**Expected Outcome**: All command metadata collected  

### 4. Process Draft (If Provided)

If draft file was provided, create clarification if needed (same as pattern-create).

**Expected Outcome**: Clarification created and answered (if needed)  

### 5. Generate Command File

Create command file from template:

**Actions**:
- Determine full filename: `{namespace}.{command-name}.md`
- Copy from command.template.md
- **CRITICAL**: Copy the exact directive header from template (lines 3-5)
  - Replace `@{namespace}-{command-name}` with actual values (e.g., `@firebase-deploy`)
  - Do NOT modify the directive text itself
  - This header is required for agents to recognize and execute the command
  - Example: `> **🤖 Agent Directive**: If you are reading this file, the command @firebase-deploy has been invoked.`
- Fill in metadata (name, version, date, description, category, frequency)
- If command has arguments: Fill in Arguments section (before Prerequisites)
- If no arguments: Remove Arguments section from template
- If draft/clarification provided: Incorporate content
- If no draft: Create from template with user-provided description
- If Key Design Decisions section was generated in Step 2.7: Insert it into the command document
- Save to `agent/commands/{namespace}.{command-name}.md`

**Expected Outcome**: Command file created with proper directive header  

### 6. Update package.yaml (If in Package)

Add command to package.yaml contents:

**Actions**:
- Read package.yaml
- Add entry to contents.commands array:
  ```yaml
  - name: {namespace}.{command-name}.md
    version: 1.0.0
    description: {description}
  ```
- Save package.yaml

**Expected Outcome**: package.yaml updated  

### 7. Update README.md (If in Package)

Update README contents section:

**Actions**:
- Call `update_readme_contents()` from common.sh
- Regenerates "What's Included" section from package.yaml

**Expected Outcome**: README.md updated with new command  

### 8. Prompt to Delete Draft (If Used)

If draft file was used, ask to delete it.

**Expected Outcome**: User chooses whether to keep draft  

### 9. Report Success

Display what was created:

**Output**:
```
✅ Command Created Successfully!

File: agent/commands/{namespace}.{command-name}.md
Namespace: {namespace}
Category: {category}
Frequency: {frequency}
Version: 1.0.0

✓ Command file created
✓ package.yaml updated (if package)
✓ README.md updated (if package)

Next steps:
- Edit the command file to add detailed steps
- Run /acp-package-validate to verify (if package)
```

**Expected Outcome**: User knows command was created successfully  

### 10. Prompt to Add to Key File Index

After successful creation, offer to add the new file to the index (if `agent/index/` exists).

**Display**:
```
Would you like to add this to the key file index?
  - Yes, add to agent/index/local.main.yaml
  - No, skip
```

If yes, prompt for weight (suggest 0.6 for commands), description, rationale, and applies values. Add entry to `agent/index/local.main.yaml`.

**Note**: Skip silently if `agent/index/` does not exist.

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating Command in Package

**Context**: In acp-firebase package directory  

**Invocation**: `/acp-command-create`  

**Interaction**:
```
Agent: Detected package context. Namespace: firebase

Agent: What would you like to name your command? (without namespace prefix)
User: deploy

Agent: Provide a one-line description:
User: Deploy Firebase functions to production

Agent: Command category? (Workflow/Documentation/Maintenance/Creation/Custom)
User: Workflow

Agent: Command frequency? (Once/Per Session/As Needed/Continuous)
User: As Needed

Agent: Command version? (default: 1.0.0)
User: [Enter]

✅ Command Created Successfully!

File: agent/commands/firebase.deploy.md
Namespace: firebase
Category: Workflow
Frequency: As Needed
Version: 1.0.0

✓ Command file created
✓ package.yaml updated
✓ README.md updated
```

### Example 2: Creating Command in Project

**Context**: In regular project (no package.yaml)  

**Invocation**: `/acp-command-create`  

**Result**: Uses "local" namespace, creates `agent/commands/local.my-command.md`, no package updates

## Related Commands

- [`/acp-pattern-create`](acp.pattern-create.md) - Create patterns
- [`/acp-design-create`](acp.design-create.md) - Create designs
- [`/acp-package-validate`](acp.package-validate.md) - Validate package after creation

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Namespace inference failed

**Symptom**: Cannot determine namespace  

**Solution**: Provide namespace manually when prompted, or check package.yaml exists and has name field  

### Issue 2: Invalid command name

**Symptom**: Command name rejected  

**Solution**: Use lowercase, alphanumeric, and hyphens only. No spaces or special characters.  

### Issue 3: package.yaml update failed

**Symptom**: Error updating package.yaml  

**Solution**: Verify package.yaml exists and is valid YAML. Run /acp-package-validate to check.

## Security Considerations

### File Access
- **Reads**: package.yaml, draft files, command templates
- **Writes**: agent/commands/{namespace}.{name}.md, package.yaml, README.md
- **Executes**: None

### Network Access
- **APIs**: None
- **Repositories**: None

### Sensitive Data
- **Secrets**: Never include secrets in commands
- **Credentials**: Never include credentials
