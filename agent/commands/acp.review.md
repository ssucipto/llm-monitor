**Namespace**: acp  
**Version**: 1.1.0  
**Created**: 2026-06-07  
**Last Updated**: 2026-08-28  
**Status**: Active  
**Scripts**: acp.review-scan.sh, acp.review-measure.sh, acp.entropy-scan.sh, acp.gitleaks.sh, acp.dupehound.sh  

---

**Purpose**: Enforce code quality, security, and consistency standards across a project's codebase using a structured **64-rule** ruleset (54 core + 10 Appendix A) aligned to OWASP Top 10:2025, OWASP MASVS v2.0, TypeScript strict mode, and industry best practices. Optional `--pr-diff` is an agent pass on `git diff <base>...HEAD`, not Phase 1 `--diff`.  
**Category**: Code Quality / Security  
**Frequency**: Per sprint, per PR, or pre-commit  

---

## Overview

`/acp-review` is a framework-level code review command that checks a project's codebase against a defined set of quality, security, and consistency rules. Unlike `/acp-audit` (deep-dive investigation) or `/acp-design-spec` (interface inventory), `/acp-review` enforces standards — it produces a structured findings report with rule IDs, severities, and fix suggestions.

**Command Positioning**:
```
/acp-audit            → agent/reports/   → INVESTIGATE (deep dive; not a PR review)
/acp-audit --pre-impl → agent/reports/   → PRE-IMPL GATE
/acp-review           → agent/reports/   → ENFORCE (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
/acp-review --pr-diff → agent/reports/   → ENFORCE on git diff base...HEAD (agent pass; not Phase 1 --diff)
/acp-design-spec      → agent/reports/   → INVENTORY (interface spec)
```

## Language Scope

The v1.0.0 ruleset targets **TypeScript / JavaScript / Node.js** projects (React, React Native, Expo, Next.js, Express). This covers the primary audience for ACP Enhanced.

For Python, Go, Rust, or other languages, the structural review framework (output format, carryover integration, CI mode) still applies, but language-specific rules (TS-01–TS-13, NC-01–NC-09) will not fire. Language detection and ruleset expansion are planned for v2.0.0.

When the project contains `agent/commands/` — i.e., an ACP-enhanced project self-reviewing — Appendix A (ACP Self-Review Rules) automatically activates. Use `--self` to scan the standard ACP Enhanced paths without relying on `src/`.

> **Phase 1 Gate Policy (M70/M83)**: deterministic enforcement is now split across three shipped surfaces: **42 built-in scanner rules** in `acp.review-scan.sh` (EH, SC, TS, AP, NC, CH, SH, YM, and ACP deterministic subsets), **1 optional local-analyzer rule** (`SH-03` via `shellcheck` when installed), and **2 ACP structure rules** enforced by `/acp-validate` (`YM-03`, `ACP-02`). **Phase 2** agent review remains **required** for the other **19 semantic rules**. CI may run Phase 1 only; do not claim "64/64 automated."

| Phase | Rules | Executor | CI gate? |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Phase 1a** | 42 built-in deterministic | `acp.review-scan.sh` | Optional pre-merge |
| **Phase 1b** | 1 optional deterministic (`SH-03`) | `acp.review-scan.sh` + local analyzer | Optional pre-merge |
| **Phase 1c** | 2 ACP structural (`YM-03`, `ACP-02`) | `/acp-validate` | Optional pre-merge |
| **Phase 2** | 19 semantic | Agent (`/acp-review`) | Required before release |

## Phase 1 Measurement

Regenerate the deterministic scanner metrics with:

```bash
bash agent/scripts/acp.review-measure.sh --ci
```

| Metric | Current corpus-backed value |
|-------|-----------------------------|
| Corpus cases | **30** labelled files in `tests/fixtures/review-corpus/` (positive + negative pairs per rule family; `SH-03` rows run only when `shellcheck` is installed) |
| Rule-level TP rows | **47** on the current corpus (`acp.review-measure.sh` ALL row) |
| Aggregate recall | 100.0% |
| Aggregate precision | 100.0% |
| CI floor | Fails below 90.0% recall or 90.0% precision |

These figures are intentionally reproducible from `tests/fixtures/review-corpus/expected.yaml`, not hand-maintained prose.

### Wall-Clock Perf Gate (M85 task-303, audit-110)

Correctness gates cannot see performance regressions: the corpus above scored
100%/100% throughout an 18x scanner slowdown that audit-110 later traced to a
YAML-parsing cost. `acp.review-measure.sh --ci` now also times a single-file
scan (median of 5 runs) and fails the build if it exceeds `--perf-budget-ms`.

| Metric | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Single-file scan (measured 2026-07-31, isolated `acp.review-scan.sh` call) | 103ms (was 199ms pre-Phase-1, ~2950ms pre-audit-110) |
| Default budget (`--perf-budget-ms`) | **450ms** — ~4.4x headroom over the isolated figure; not tuned to sit just above it |
| What the gate actually times | The full `acp.review-measure.sh` subprocess path (`bash` + script sourcing overhead included), typically 300-360ms locally — still comfortably under budget |
| CI floor | Fails when the median exceeds the budget; failure message names the budget, the observed median, and audit-110 |

Regenerate with `bash agent/scripts/acp.review-measure.sh --ci` — the timing line prints on every run, not only on failure, so drift is visible before it breaks a build.

## Ruleset Size

| Layer | Count | Rule prefixes |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Core rules (Categories 1–6) | **54** | EH, TS, NC, AP, CH, SC |
| Appendix A (ACP self-review) | **10** | SH, YM, ACP |
| **Total distinct rule IDs** | **64** | v1.0.0 |

> **19 semantic rules** still require Phase 2 agent review. CI may run Phase 1 only; do not claim **64/64** automated enforcement.

## Rule Ownership

`/acp-review` is the **code-quality and application-security** surface. It intentionally does **not** own every ACP integrity or framework-structure concern.

| Surface | Owns | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| `acp.review-scan.sh` | **42 built-in** Phase 1 rules across EH, SC, TS, AP, NC, CH, SH, YM, and ACP families; **optional `SH-03`** via `shellcheck` | Full rule-id list: `agent/wiki/coderabbit-policy-map-lite.md` § Phase 1 |
| `/acp-review` agent pass | **19 semantic** review rules | Release gate; covers A06 design review and the bulk of MASVS / code-health reasoning |
| `/acp-validate` | `YM-03`, `ACP-02` | ACP framework structure and parity checks; automated, but not part of the scanner |
| `/acp-integrity` | OWASP A08:2025 integrity and provenance ownership | Tampering, hidden Unicode, exfiltration, dependency trust, and other `IG-*` checks belong to the trust surface |

## Standards Coverage

| OWASP Top 10:2025 | Status | Primary coverage | Rationale |
|-------------------|--------|------------------|-----------|
| A01 Broken Access Control | Covered | `SC-06`–`SC-09` | Route authz, admin guards, CORS, and SSRF checks live in review rules |
| A02 Security Misconfiguration | Covered | `SC-10`–`SC-13` | Config validation, headers, default creds, and error leakage are review concerns |
| A03 Supply Chain Failures | Covered | `SC-14`–`SC-15` | Dependency CVEs and lockfile discipline stay under `/acp-review` |
| A04 Cryptographic Failures | Covered | `SC-16`–`SC-18` | Hashing, encryption at rest, and TLS posture are review rules |
| A05 Injection | Partially covered | `SC-02`–`SC-04` | Input validation and dangerous sinks are covered here; hardcoded secrets are **not** counted as injection |
| A06 Insecure Design | Deliberately not covered by scanner | Phase 2 agent review | Threat modeling and design flaws require semantic/design review, not deterministic scanning |
| A07 Authentication Failures | Partially covered | `SC-23`, `SC-24`, `SC-25` | Auth handling/logging signals exist, but credential-strength/session-policy checks remain Phase 2/manual |
| A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures | Owned by `/acp-integrity` | `IG-*` integrity rules | Trust/provenance and tamper detection are the companion command's responsibility |
| A09 Security Logging and Alerting Failures | Covered | `SC-24`–`SC-25` | Review owns auth-event and authz-failure logging expectations |
| A10 Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions | Covered | `EH-01`–`EH-11` | Error-handling category maps directly here |

## ACP Enhanced Self-Review Recipe

When reviewing this repository (no `src/` directory), use:

```
/acp-review --self --rules typescript,security,code-health --report
/acp-validate
/acp-integrity --self --fast
```

Or run the deterministic scanner directly:

```bash
bash agent/scripts/acp.review-scan.sh --ci scripts/ agent/scripts/
```

For fixture corpora or intentionally bad samples, opt back into excluded paths:

```bash
bash agent/scripts/acp.review-scan.sh --include-tests tests/fixtures/review-corpus/
```

---

## Arguments

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `[path]` | File or directory; defaults to `src/` when present, else project root |
| `--self` | ACP Enhanced self-review: `scripts/`, `agent/scripts/`, `agent/commands/`, `e2e/` |
| `--include-tests` | Include default-excluded paths matching `*test*`, `*spec*`, `*fixture*`, `*__mocks__*`, `*.generated.*`, `*.min.js` |
| `--rules <category>` | Limit to one category: `error-handling`, `typescript`, `naming`, `api`, `code-health`, `security`, `mobile` |
| `--severity <level>` | Minimum level: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` |
| `--scope <web\|mobile\|all>` | Platform scoping (default: `all`) |
| `--ci` | Compact output, exit 1 on CRITICAL/HIGH findings |
| `--carryover` | Write HIGH+ to `agent/memory/audit-carryovers.md` |
| `--report` | Save structured YAML + prose to `agent/reports/review-NNN.md` (local only; ADR-27 — do not commit) |
| `--fix-suggestions` | Include inline fix per finding |
| `--baseline <file>` | Suppress findings already present in a baseline file (`rule + file + normalized snippet hash`) |
| `--write-baseline <file>` | Write the current findings to a reusable baseline file |
| `--diff` | Review only files changed since last commit (or named ref) — uses `git diff --name-only` |
| `--pr-diff` | Optional **agent** pass on `git diff <base>...HEAD` (not Phase 1; not `/acp-audit`; not weekly `--report --carryover`) |
| `--base <ref>` | Explicit base for `--pr-diff`. If omitted: open PR `baseRefName` via `gh` when available, else `origin/` + `identity.yml` `default_working_branch` |
| `--owasp` | Include OWASP Top 10:2025 / MASVS v2 mapping in output |
| `--ignore <pattern>` | Exclude file pattern |

`--diff` and `--pr-diff` are **not** aliases (D14). They are **combinable**: `--diff` still scopes **Phase 1** to `git diff --name-only`. `--pr-diff` is an **additional** agent pass on `git diff <base>...HEAD`. If both flags are present, run both. Do not drop `--diff` semantics.

### Category 6 — Security Baseline
**Standards**: OWASP Top 10:2025, OWASP ASVS, OWASP MASVS v2.0, NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5, CWE-798

#### 6a — Secret Hygiene (CWE-798 / OWASP ASVS)

| Rule ID | Rule | Severity | Scope | Phase 1 |
|---------|------|----------|-------|---------|
| SC-01 | No hardcoded secrets, tokens, passwords, or API keys in source files | CRITICAL | ALL | **Y** |
| SC-05 | Sensitive data (PII, tokens, passwords) must not appear in logs | HIGH | ALL | N |

#### 6b — Injection (OWASP A05:2025)

| Rule ID | Rule | Severity | Scope | Phase 1 |
|---------|------|----------|-------|---------|
| SC-02 | All user-supplied input validated before use — `zod` schemas or equivalent | HIGH | ALL | N |
| SC-03 | `eval()`, `new Function()`, `setTimeout(string)`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitisation forbidden | HIGH | WEB |

#### 6c — Access Control (OWASP A01:2025)

| Rule ID | Rule | Severity | Scope |
|---------|------|----------|-------|

| SC-07 | Admin-only routes must check role before processing — never rely on obscure URLs | CRITICAL | WEB |
| SC-08 | CORS configuration must not use wildcard `*` in production | HIGH | WEB |
| SC-09 | SSRF — outbound URL targets from user input validated against allowlist | HIGH | WEB |

#### 6d — Security Misconfiguration (OWASP A02:2025)

| Rule ID | Rule | Severity | Scope |
|---------|------|----------|-------|

| SC-14 | No dependencies with known HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs — enforce via `npm audit --audit-level=high` | HIGH | ALL |
| SC-15 | Lock files committed and kept in sync for reproducible builds. Phase 1 raises SC-15 when no lockfile exists, or when one exists but is **untracked and not gitignored** (an accident that breaks `npm ci`). A deliberately gitignored lockfile is exempt — framework/protocol projects where lockfiles are development-only (M55 G-001). Outside a git work tree the rule asserts nothing. | HIGH | ALL |

| Rule ID | Rule | Severity | Scope |
|---------|------|----------|-------|
| SC-24 | Auth events (login, failure, logout, password reset) logged with timestamp + user ID | HIGH | ALL |

    fix: "Log structured error and rethrow, or return typed error"
```

---

## Quality Gates

1. **Findings reflect code, not intent** — agents must read actual file contents
2. **Security findings override `--severity` filter** — CRITICAL always reported
3. **No false negatives for EH-01/EH-02/SC-06** — flag with uncertainty note
4. **`--carryover` creates one entry per finding** — granular tracking
5. **`--ci` exits 1 on CRITICAL or HIGH** — safe for pre-commit hooks
6. **Agents must never auto-fix** — report only; fixing is a separate routed task
7. **Mobile rules activate when `--scope mobile`** and project detected as React Native/Expo
8. **Re-verification required on carryover resolution** — never self-assess as fixed

---

## Executor Selection

**Qualified executors** (in capability order):

| Executor | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| Composer 2.5 | Full-project reviews, Cursor-native workflow, long-horizon |
| DeepSeek V4 Pro | Cross-component consistency, OpenRouter dispatch, cost-efficient |
| Kimi K2.6 | Polyglot codebases, long-horizon sessions |
| Qwen3 235B A22B | CI/high-volume, extreme cost efficiency |

**Disqualified**: DeepSeek V4 Flash, DeepSeek V4 Flash-Max — insufficient cross-file reasoning for security and consistency review.

**Per-task routing**:
```
--rules naming,code-health         → DeepSeek V4 Pro
--rules error-handling,typescript  → DeepSeek V4 Pro or Composer 2.5
--rules security                   → Composer 2.5 (preferred)
--rules mobile (MASVS)             → Composer 2.5 or Kimi K2.6
--ci (CI pipeline)                 → Qwen3 235B A22B
full codebase, all rules           → Composer 2.5
```

---

## Steps

1. **Invoke the command**: Run `/acp-review` with the desired rule set (`--rules <category>`, `--self`, or default).
2. **Run Phase 1 scanner** (optional, recommended for CI): `bash agent/scripts/acp.review-scan.sh [--ci] [path]` — 42 built-in deterministic rules across EH, SC, TS, AP, NC, CH, SH, YM, and ACP families, plus optional `SH-03` via `shellcheck`.
3. **Scan the codebase**: The agent examines project files against the 64-rule framework aligned to OWASP Top 10:2025 and TypeScript strict mode.
4. **Produce findings**: Generate a structured findings report with rule IDs, severities (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), file locations, and fix suggestions.
5. **Prioritize fixes**: CRITICAL and HIGH findings should be addressed before commit. MEDIUM findings before PR merge. LOW findings tracked for next sprint.
6. **Verify**: Run the **Verification Checklist** at the bottom of this document to confirm the review completed correctly.

**`--self` path resolution**: When `--self` is passed, scan these paths in order: `scripts/`, `agent/scripts/`, `agent/commands/`, `e2e/`. Skip missing directories silently.

---

## Phase 2.5 — `--pr-diff` (optional)

This is an **agent** pass. It is **not** Phase 1. It does **not** change `acp.review-scan.sh`. Do not invent an LLM harness in CI. `/acp-audit` is not this flag.

### Base ref (D3 / D17)

1. `--base <ref>` if given.
2. Else, if an open PR exists: `baseRefName` from `gh`. Probe `gh` in a **subprocess**, not the agent interactive shell:

```bash
bash -c 'command -v gh'
```

If `gh` is missing, not authenticated, or there is no open PR: do **not** fail `--pr-diff`. Use `origin/` + `git_workflow.default_working_branch` from `agent/core/identity.yml`.

3. Diff is **triple-dot only**: `git diff <base>...HEAD`.

### Output

Write `agent/reports/review-N-pr-diff.md` (local only; **ADR-27 — do not commit**; do not `git add -f`). This is **not** the weekly `/acp-review --report --carryover` report. Do not change that recurring command string.

### Portable checklist (D5)

Review the patch for: honesty of user-visible results; authorization/cache; parse-unknown; enqueue ≠ sync; dates/IDs; formatter; **then Stop**.

Do not grow Phase 1 regex for these classes. Promote recurring misses into **project** convention tests.

### Posted LLM comments (when acting on them)

Bucket table (portable wording — no product stack names):

| Bucket | Meaning | This pass |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **A — production** | User-visible correctness, authz/cache, parse-unknown, enqueue ≠ sync, dates/IDs, formatter | Blocking until fixed or explicitly deferred |
| **B — helper** | Helper/test/tooling nits, style onions | At most **one** architecture-level change; remainder non-blocking after one parser/compiler-level fix |

Merge line: **CI green + this pass — not CodeRabbit HEAD**.

### Confirm block (required before you stop)

Emit a confirm block, then **Stop** (do not start unrelated refactors):

```
Confirm (--pr-diff)
  Base: <ref>
  Blocking: <list or none>
  Bucket A: <list or none>
  Bucket B architecture (≤1): <item or none>
  Deferred nits: <list or none>
  Merge: CI green + this pass — not CodeRabbit HEAD
  Stop.
```

## Default Exclusions

To avoid high-noise false positives from test data, the deterministic scanner skips these path patterns by default:

- `*test*`
- `*spec*`
- `*fixture*`
- `*__mocks__*`
- `*.generated.*`
- `*.min.js`

Use `--include-tests` when scanning labelled corpora, intentionally bad fixtures, or generated samples that are part of review verification.

---

## Scanner Limitations

Phase 1 TypeScript/JavaScript rules use a **character-walker** (`acp.review-scan-ts.py`) that strips comments and string literals before regex matching. It is **not** an AST or tree-sitter analyzer (F-105-02). Implications:

- Rules cannot reason about scope, types, imports, or control flow.
- Complex signatures, nested generics, and semantic equivalents may be missed or approximated.
- Corpus metrics (`acp.review-measure.sh`) validate the **fixture set**, not production-scale recall.

Upgrade path (only if fixture FP rate rises): tree-sitter or TypeScript compiler API integration — deferred to backlog.

## CodeRabbit Augmentation (when `coderabbit_active`)

When `bash agent/scripts/acp.coderabbit.sh active` returns true (preference enabled **and** config file present):

| Phase | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | **Never deferred** — all deterministic scanner rules still run via `acp.review-scan.sh` |
| **Phase 2** | For policy-map rows with `owner: coderabbit` or `both`, add annotation: “also covered by CodeRabbit — verify via PR review or `bash agent/scripts/acp.findings-import.sh --input …`” |
| **ACP-owned Phase 2** | Always run — review remains valid standalone when CodeRabbit is inactive |

Import path (M81 — fixture committed at `tests/fixtures/coderabbit-findings-sample.json`):

```bash
bash agent/scripts/acp.findings-import.sh --input tests/fixtures/coderabbit-findings-sample.json
```

Phase 1 deterministic rules are **never** deferred to CodeRabbit (F-101-07). Weekly `progress.yaml` recurring task stays `command: /acp-review --report --carryover` — CodeRabbit behavior lives in this doc, not a step list (F-101-02). Do **not** invent `/acp-findings-import` (F-101-06).

See `agent/wiki/coderabbit-policy-map-lite.md` and `agent/wiki/coderabbit-integration.md`.

When CodeRabbit (or another LLM review) has **posted comments**, bucket them in this pass using the Phase 2.5 table. Do **not** wait for a silent or rate-limited CodeRabbit check to merge. Green CodeRabbit is not a review of HEAD.

## Optional Tool Delegation

`SH-03` is delegated to `shellcheck` when it is installed locally. The scanner runs the normal `shellcheck -f gcc -S warning` pass, then promotes quote-safety findings `SC2046`, `SC2068`, and `SC2086` from a filtered style-level pass into `SH-03` findings. Sourced-library allowlists match `SH-01` so utility libraries and `e2e/` helpers do not create known-benign noise.

`SC-01` keeps a small always-on fallback for structured prefixes and obvious secret assignments, then layers optional `gitleaks` findings on top when `integrations.gitleaks.enabled` is `auto`/`true` and the local binary is present. The scanner also reuses `acp.entropy-scan.sh --review-sc01` for high-entropy secret-like assignments; entropy complements prefix patterns and does not replace them.

`CH-05` is delegated to `dupehound` when `integrations.dupehound.enabled` is `auto`/`true` and the local binary is present. Findings are emitted as `CH-05 / MEDIUM`; in `--ci` they stay non-blocking because only CRITICAL/HIGH findings fail the scanner.

When an optional analyzer is absent, the scanner stays silent and that rule remains a Phase 2/manual review concern.

## False-Positive Controls

`/acp-review` now ships the minimum controls needed to adopt the scanner on an existing codebase without disabling whole rules:

- `--baseline <file>` suppresses previously accepted findings by `rule + file + normalized snippet hash`, so unrelated line shifts do not invalidate the entry.
- `--write-baseline <file>` writes the current findings into a reusable baseline file. Only findings that are still **active** are captured: a finding suppressed by a disabled `rule_override` or by an inline `acp-review-ignore` comment is **not** written to the baseline, so removing that comment later re-surfaces the issue instead of leaving it permanently hidden behind the baseline. Findings suppressed by an **existing** `--baseline` are still carried forward, so re-baselining never drops previously accepted entries.
- Inline suppression is supported on the same line or the immediately preceding line:

```ts
// acp-review-ignore: SC-01 - seeded fixture credential
const token = "ghp_example_fixture_token";
```

```sh
# acp-review-ignore: SH-03 - deliberate unquoted expansion in test fixture
echo $HOME
```

- A suppression **must include a reason**. Missing reasons are reported as a `LOW` finding and do **not** suppress the original issue.
- Text output always prints a suppression summary. `--json` includes `summary.suppressed_total`, `summary.suppressed_baseline`, `summary.suppressed_inline`, and `summary.suppressed_rule_override`.
- **Per-rule overrides** — project preference `review.rule_overrides` maps rule IDs to `enabled: false` and/or `severity: LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL`. Disabled rules are suppressed project-wide; severity overrides apply before baseline/inline checks. Example:

```yaml
# agent/preferences/acp.default.yaml
acp:
  review:
    rule_overrides:
      NC-01:
        enabled: false
      CH-03:
        severity: LOW
```

See [review-legacy-adoption.md](../wiki/review-legacy-adoption.md) for the baseline → tighten adoption workflow.

These controls are shared with `/acp-integrity` through `agent/scripts/acp.integrity-output.sh`.

## Rule Authoring Checklist (Phase 1)

When adding or changing a deterministic rule in `acp.review-scan.sh`, follow
See `agent/wiki/architecture.md` (rule-verification discipline lives in a local pattern on maintainer clones — ADR-29):

1. Write the **invariant** in one sentence (not a correlate).
2. Implement a probe that asserts that invariant (e.g. resolve modules — do not treat `scripts/node_modules/` existence as “YAML rules can run”).
3. Ship a **true-positive fixture** and a **false-positive fixture** (comments/strings/vendored trees).
4. Setup failures must **skip or fail-closed in `--ci`**, never emit the rule as a finding.
5. Document the rule ID in this file’s tables and keep `review_rg_dir` / `find` excludes aligned.

| SH-03 | No unquoted variables in scripts (delegated to `shellcheck` when available) | MEDIUM |
| SH-04 | No `trap cleanup EXIT` inside sourced functions (subshell inheritance risk) | CRITICAL |
| YM-01 | All YAML files parse cleanly — no unquoted `{}` braces in flow sequences | HIGH |
| YM-02 | All Markdown frontmatter parses as valid YAML | MEDIUM |
| YM-03 | Version fields consistent across 8+ version-bearing files | HIGH |
| ACP-01 | Command docs have `🤖 Agent Directive` header | MEDIUM |
| ACP-02 | Every command has an E2E test file | MEDIUM |
| ACP-03 | Scripts follow naming convention `acp.{name}.sh` | LOW |
