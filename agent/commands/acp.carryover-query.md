## What This Command Does

Search the `agent/memory/audit-carryovers.md` file for carryover entries. The file can
grow to 5000+ lines in production use (consumer-project), making manual inspection impractical.
This command provides structured querying by status, severity, audit, or keyword.

    File: [no specific file]
    Fix: Create route for E2E tests covering commit auto-sync
    Escalated: M48 routes 085-086

  GAP-041-08 (medium): Atomicity not addressed in sync design
