**Namespace**: acp  
**Version**: 2.4.0  
**Created**: 2026-02-16  
**Last Updated**: 2026-06-15  
**Status**: Active  
**Scripts**: None

**Purpose**: Validate all ACP documents for structure, consistency, correctness, and namespace conventions  
**Category**: Documentation  
**Frequency**: As Needed  

---

## What This Command Does

This command validates all ACP documentation to ensure it follows proper structure, maintains consistency, contains no errors, and follows namespace conventions. It checks document formatting, verifies links and references, validates YAML syntax, ensures all required sections are present, validates namespace usage, and checks for reserved name violations.

Use this command before committing documentation changes, after creating new documents, or periodically to ensure documentation quality. It's particularly useful before releases or when onboarding new contributors.

Unlike `/acp-sync` which compares docs to code, `/acp-validate` checks the internal consistency and correctness of the documentation itself. Unlike `/acp-package-validate` which is for package authors, this command validates general ACP project documentation.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] ACP installed in project
- [ ] Documentation exists in `agent/` directory
- [ ] You want to verify documentation quality

---

## Steps

### 0. Display Command Header

```
⚡ /acp-validate
  Validate all ACP documents for structure, consistency, correctness, and namespace conventions

  Usage:
    /acp-validate                    Standard validation (all steps except 2b)
    /acp-validate --memory           Standard + memory YAML lint (step 2b)

  Related:
    /acp-package-validate  Package-specific validation
    /acp-sync              Sync documentation with code
    /acp-update            Update progress tracking
    /acp-report            Generate report with validation results
    /acp-init              Can include validation during init
```

This step is informational only — do not wait for user input.

### 1. Validate Directory Structure

Check that all required directories and files exist.

**Actions**:
- Verify `agent/` directory exists
- Check for `agent/design/`, `agent/milestones/`, `agent/patterns/`, `agent/tasks/`
- Verify `agent/progress.yaml` exists
- Check for `agent/commands/` directory
- Note any missing directories

**Expected Outcome**: Directory structure validated  

### 2. Validate progress.yaml

Check YAML syntax and required fields.

**Actions**:
- Parse `agent/progress.yaml` as YAML
- Verify required fields exist (project, milestones, tasks)
- Check field types (strings, numbers, dates)
- Validate date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Verify progress percentages (0-100)
- Check milestone/task references are consistent
- Validate status values (not_started, in_progress, completed)

**Expected Outcome**: progress.yaml is valid  

### 2b. Validate Memory YAML (--memory flag only)

> **This step runs ONLY when `--memory` is passed.** Without `--memory`, skip to Step 3.

YAML-parse the memory registry files and fail on syntax errors with line numbers.
This complements the existing Step 11.6 structural validation (required keys, date
format) by adding raw YAML syntax checking.

**Actions**:

1. **Validate `agent/memory/patterns.md`**:
   - Parse as YAML
   - Check for: duplicate mapping keys, bad indentation, unquoted colons in scalar values
   - If parse fails → report `FAIL: agent/memory/patterns.md: line N: {error message}`
   - If parse succeeds → report `PASS: agent/memory/patterns.md: N entries`

2. **Validate `agent/memory/sessions.md`**:
   - Parse as YAML
   - Handle both regular entries and `type: weekly-summary` blocks
   - Same error reporting as patterns.md

3. **Validate `agent/progress.yaml`** (enhanced — currently structural only):
   - Parse as YAML (full syntax validation, not just field checking)
   - Check for unquoted colons in `notes:` and `key_fact:` values
   - Report line numbers for syntax errors

4. **Schema checks** (v6.9.1+ — warnings, do not affect exit code):
   - **Patterns**: Each entry MUST have `date:` and `name:` fields.
     Warn if missing. Warn on unquoted colons in `description:` values.
   - **Sessions**: Each entry MUST have `date:` or `type:` field.
     Warn if neither present. Warn on unquoted colons in `key_fact:` values.
   - **Progress**: Warn on unquoted colons in `notes:` values.
   
   Output format:
   ```
   ⚠️ agent/memory/patterns.md: entry 5 missing required field 'name:'
   ⚠️ agent/memory/patterns.md: line 120 unquoted colon in 'description:'
   ⚠️ agent/memory/sessions.md: entry 3 has neither 'date:' nor 'type:'
   ```

**Exit code**: 1 if any YAML parse fails; 0 if all parse successfully.
Schema warnings are informational and do not affect exit code.

**Expected Outcome**: Memory files are valid YAML; syntax errors reported with line numbers  

### 2c. Validate Version Consistency (v6.9.1+)

> **This step runs in ALL modes** (standard and --memory). Version drift across
> 8+ files is a recurring bug — this check prevents it.

Compare the canonical version in `agent/core/identity.yml` against all other version-bearing files. The TypeScript validator (`scripts/acp-validate.ts`) compares `identity.yml` to the `AGENTS.md` `> vX.Y.Z` header (soft warn on drift).

**Actions**:

1. **Read canonical version**: Extract `version` from `agent/core/identity.yml` (also check `project.version` in `agent/progress.yaml`).
2. **Check hard requirements** (ERROR if mismatch):
   - `AGENTS.md` → `> vX.Y.Z` protocol header line
   - `agent/core/identity.yml` → `version: X.Y.Z`
   - `package.yaml` → `version: X.Y.Z` (if file exists)
3. **Check soft requirements** (WARN if mismatch):
   - `README.md` → version badge in shields.io URL
   - `CHANGELOG.md` → latest `## [X.Y.Z]` entry
   - `scripts/PRD-MAIN.md` → `**Version:** X.Y`
- **`IP_REGISTER.md`** → `**Current Version** | X.Y.Z` **only if the file exists** (public clones omit it — ADR-29; missing is not an error)
4. **Report**:

```
🔍 Version Consistency (canonical: X.Y.Z from progress.yaml):

  Hard requirements:
    ✅ AGENT.md: X.Y.Z
    ✅ identity.yml: X.Y.Z
    ✅ package.yaml: X.Y.Z

  Soft requirements:
    ✅ README.md: X.Y.Z
    ✅ CHANGELOG.md: X.Y.Z
    ⚠️ PRD-MAIN.md: X.Y.W → expected X.Y.Z
    ⚠️ IP_REGISTER.md: A.B.C → expected X.Y.Z
```

5. **Exit code**: Hard mismatches fail (exit 1). Soft mismatches warn only.

**Expected Outcome**: All version-bearing files consistent; drift reported with expected value  

### 2d. Validate Recurring Tasks (v6.12.1+)

Validate the `recurring_tasks:` block in `agent/progress.yaml`.

**Actions**:

1. **Check block exists**: If `recurring_tasks:` is absent → WARN (optional feature, not required).
2. **Validate each task entry** (ERROR if violation):
   - `id`: required, kebab-case, non-empty
   - `command`: required, must start with `/acp-`
   - `executor`: required, non-empty
   - `status`: must be one of `current | paused | overdue | completed`
   - `frequency` OR `trigger`: at least one must be present
   - `last_run` / `next_due`: if present, must be valid dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. **Check for overdue tasks**: If `status: current` and `next_due` <= today → flag as overdue.
4. **Warn on duplicate IDs**: Two tasks with same `id` → ERROR.
5. **Report**:

```
🔍 Recurring Tasks (v6.12.1+):

  Schema validation:
    ✅ weekly-code-review: valid
    ✅ weekly-integrity-scan: valid
    ✅ pre-commit-rule-audit: valid (event trigger)
    ✅ monthly-dependency-audit: valid
    ✅ quarterly-deep-scan: valid
    ✅ pre-commit-integrity-phase1: valid (event trigger)
    ✅ ci-npm-ignore-scripts: valid (event trigger)
    ✅ post-milestone-sweep: valid (event trigger)

  Overdue check:
    ⚠️ weekly-code-review: due 2026-06-15 (7 days from now)
    ✅ weekly-integrity-scan: due 2026-06-15 (7 days from now)

  Summary: 8 tasks, 0 errors, 0 overdue, 2 upcoming
```

**Expected Outcome**: Recurring tasks validated; overdue tasks surfaced  

### 2e. Validate Cross-Layer Status Consistency (v6.20.1+)

> **This step runs in ALL modes**. Mismatches are ERRORS (exit 1).

Compare the `**Status**` field in every milestone document against the `status` field in `progress.yaml`. Documents and progress.yaml MUST agree. This prevents the type of desync that audit-069 discovered, where milestone docs were reset to `planned` by a merge while `progress.yaml` correctly showed them as `completed`.

**Actions**:
- Parse `progress.yaml` milestones (id, status, file)
- For each milestone with a `file:`, open the milestone doc, read its `**Status**:` field
- Normalize both values (map `active` → `in_progress`, `implemented` → `completed`, etc.)
- FAIL if they disagree (ERROR, exit 1)

**Expected Outcome**: All milestone docs agree with progress.yaml on status

> **Implementation note**: Enforced by `scripts/acp-validate.ts` (`validateStatusConsistency()` / `loadProgressSafe()`) in the no-args validation path (Step 11.6).

### 2f. Validate File Pointers (v6.20.1+)

> **This step runs in ALL modes**. Dangling pointers are ERRORS (exit 1).

Verify every `file:` pointer in `progress.yaml` references an existing file. This catches stale references before they reach readers.

**Actions**:
- For every `file:` path in progress.yaml (milestones), assert the file exists on disk
- Skip gitignored pointers (ADR-28 instance milestone bodies; ADR-29 instance designs) — CI clones omit those files
- FAIL listing each dangling pointer that is not gitignored (ERROR, exit 1)
- Flag `tasks_total: 0` combined with `status: active|in_progress` as an inconsistency

**Expected Outcome**: No dangling file pointers; no contradictory task counts

> **Implementation note**: This check is enforced by `scripts/acp-validate.ts` (`validateFilePointers()`) in the no-args validation path (Step 11.6).

### 2g. Validate Memory & Hook Integrity (v6.29.3+)

> **This step runs in ALL modes**. All three checks are ERRORS (exit 1).

Three gates that close silent-corruption paths found by audits 107–110. Each replaced a
condition that previously passed validation while data was being lost.

**Actions**:

1. **Memory duplicate keys** — for every entry in `sessions.md`, `lessons.md`,
   `patterns.md` and `audit-carryovers.md`, fail on a repeated top-level key.
   An edit that deletes the *following* entry's list header merges two entries;
   key-presence checks still pass and the entry count absorbs the merge, while YAML
   last-wins silently shadows the earlier entry's values. Shipping this found four real
   pre-existing corruptions.
   - Entries are split on **any** list marker (`- <key>:`), never on a known first key —
     `sessions.md` legitimately mixes `- date:` entries with `- type: weekly-summary`
     compaction blocks.

2. **`progress.yaml` strict parse** — fail when the file does not parse as strict YAML.
   `loadProgressSafe()` deliberately falls back to line-based extraction so other checks
   still run, but on its own that downgraded the 191-duplicate-key incident to a console
   warning with a green exit code.

3. **Hook task bindings (ADR-20)** — every `hooks.<phase>[].task_id` in
   `agent/core/constraints.yml` MUST resolve to a `recurring_tasks[].id` in
   `progress.yaml`. A dangling hook silently fires nothing; 3 of 4 `pre_commit` hooks
   were dangling when this check was added.

**Expected Outcome**: No duplicate memory keys; progress.yaml parses strictly; every hook
resolves to a real recurring task

```
✅ Memory duplicate-key check: 328 entries, no duplicate keys
✅ progress.yaml: parses as strict YAML (no duplicate keys)
✅ Hook bindings: 4 hook(s) resolve to recurring_tasks (ADR-20)
```

> **Implementation note**: Enforced by `scripts/acp-validate.ts` —
> `validateMemoryDuplicateKeys()` / `findDuplicateEntryKeys()`,
> `validateProgressYamlParses()`, and `validateHookTaskBindings()`. Unit-tested in
> `scripts/acp-validate.test.ts`.

### 3. Validate Design Documents

Check design document structure and content.

**Actions**:
- Read all files in `agent/design/`
- Verify required sections exist (Overview, Problem, Solution)
- Check for proper markdown formatting
- Validate code blocks have language tags
- Verify dates are in correct format
- Check status values are valid
- Ensure no broken internal links

**Expected Outcome**: Design docs are well-formed  

### 4. Validate Milestone Documents

Check milestone document structure.

**Actions**:
- Read all files in `agent/milestones/`
- Verify required sections (Overview, Deliverables, Success Criteria)
- Check naming convention (milestone-N-name.md)
- Validate task references exist
- Verify success criteria are checkboxes
- Check for proper formatting

**Expected Outcome**: Milestone docs are valid  

### 5. Validate Task Documents

Check task document structure and self-containment.

**Actions**:
- Read all files in `agent/tasks/`
- Verify required sections (Objective, Steps, Verification)
- Check naming convention (task-N-name.md)
- Validate milestone references
- Verify verification items are checkboxes
- Check for proper formatting
- Run **Self-Containment Probes** on every task with marker `status:` of `draft`, `in_progress`, or `not_started` (skip tasks marked `complete` — retroactive probing is noise)

**Expected Outcome**: Task docs are structurally valid AND incomplete tasks have verified self-containment  

#### 5.1. Self-Containment Probes

The Self-Contained Task Principle requires every relevant design excerpt, spec requirement, and clarification decision to be inlined verbatim in the task body so sub-agents have all the context they need without opening other files. These probes confirm the task actually did the inlining.

All three probes are **reading-comprehension checks**: you (as validate's executing agent) read the task file and the referenced files, then judge whether the claimed content is meaningfully reflected in the task body. No fingerprints, no thresholds — you compare.

All findings are **soft warnings**. They never hard-fail validate; they appear in the Self-Containment section of Step 12's report and the user decides whether each is deliberate scoping or missed inlining.

**Probe 1 — Spec inlining**

For each incomplete task with `/acp-meta.task` marker fields `spec:` + `covers:`:

1. Read the spec file from `spec:`.
2. Locate each `R<N>` listed in `covers:`.
3. For each R-ID: does the task body reflect R<N>'s substance — its MUST/SHOULD language, its constraint, its short description — somewhere in Steps, Context, or a `## Spec Coverage` section? A `- [ ] R<N>: <description>` line counts. So does a paraphrase that captures the constraint.
4. For each R-ID that is NOT reflected in the body, emit a finding:
   ```
   ⚠️ <task_path>  (<status>)
      Probe 1 (spec): covers: <R-ID> but <R-ID>'s text not reflected in body
      → Inline from <spec_path> under Spec Coverage
   ```

Deferral phrasing (e.g., "R11 deferred to task-19", "R13 scoped out — handled by milestone M11") is NOT a finding — recognize it and skip.

**Probe 2 — Design inlining**

For each incomplete task with `**Design Reference**: [name](path) | None` resolving to a real file:

1. Read the design file. Locate every D-ID in it (look for `\*\*D\d+[:\s*]` bold-prefix form or `### D\d+:` heading form).
2. Three sub-cases:
   - **Design has D-IDs AND task marker has `incorporates:` listing some of them**: for each D-ID in `incorporates:`, confirm that D-ID's atomic unit (the decision text, code snippet, schema, algorithm, interface, rule, or diagram) is reflected verbatim or faithfully paraphrased in the task body. Flag specific missing D-IDs with their short title:
     ```
     ⚠️ <task_path>  (<status>)
        Probe 2 (design): incorporates: <D-ID> but <D-ID> (<short title>) not found in body
        → Inline from <design_path>
     ```
   - **Design has D-IDs but task marker has no `incorporates:` field**: soft-warn:
     ```
     ⚠️ <task_path>  (<status>)
        Probe 2 (design): design <design_path> has D<min>..D<max> but task
        marker has no `incorporates:` field.
        → Add `incorporates:` for relevant D-IDs, or justify the omission in the task body
          (e.g., "scoped-out: D2-D4 handled by task-19")
     ```
   - **Design has no D-IDs (legacy, pre-v5.41)**: fall back to a holistic judgment: "does the task body contain substantive content from the design?" Scan for atomic units in the design (fenced code blocks, definition lists, key invariants in the Implementation / Solution / Edge Cases / Interfaces sections) that appear uncovered. Flag with a snippet:
     ```
     ⚠️ <task_path>  (<status>)
        Probe 2 (design, legacy): design <design_path> has no D-IDs and task
        body doesn't reflect substantive design content.
        Missing likely: <snippet from unreflected section>
        → Consider backfilling D-IDs in the design (run /acp-sync), then claim
          specific D-IDs in this task's `incorporates:` field
     ```

Deferral phrasing is NOT a finding, as in Probe 1.

**Probe 3 — Clarification inlining**

Invoke:
```sh
./agent/scripts/acp.meta-scan.sh --kind clarification agent/clarifications/
```

For each clarification block with `resolves:` matching the task's path AND `resolved: true`:

1. Read the clarification file. Identify the resolved decisions (typically in the answers, resolutions, or a "Resolved Decisions" subsection).
2. For each resolved decision, check the task body reflects it — either in Steps, Context, or Key Design Decisions.
3. For each unreflected decision, emit a finding:
   ```
   ⚠️ <task_path>  (<status>)
      Probe 3 (clarification): <clarification_path> resolved
      '<short summary of decision>' but not inlined in task
      → Inline the decision under Steps or Key Design Decisions
   ```

#### Self-Containment vs structural validation

Structural findings (missing `## Verification`, malformed milestone link, etc.) remain **errors** that fail validate.

Self-containment findings are **warnings** that do NOT fail validate. If a task has only self-containment warnings and no structural errors, the overall status in Step 12 is "passed with warnings."

### 6. Validate Pattern Documents

Check pattern document structure.

**Actions**:
- Read all files in `agent/patterns/`
- Verify required sections (Overview, Implementation, Examples)
- Check code examples are properly formatted
- Validate examples have language tags
- Verify no broken links

**Expected Outcome**: Pattern docs are valid  

### 7. Validate Command Documents

Check command document structure.

**Actions**:
- Read all files in `agent/commands/`
- Verify required sections (Purpose, Steps, Verification)
- Check agent directive is present
- Validate namespace and version fields
- Verify examples are complete
- Check related commands links work

**Expected Outcome**: Command docs are valid  

### 8. Validate Artifact Documents

Check artifact document structure and staleness.

**Actions**:
- Read all files in `agent/artifacts/` matching `research-*.md`, `glossary-*.md`, `reference-*.md`
- **Validate metadata block**:
  - Verify required fields exist: Type, Created, Last Verified, Status, Confidence, Category, Sources
  - Check Type is one of: research, glossary, reference
  - Validate Created format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Validate Last Verified format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Check Status is one of: Active, Stale, Deprecated, WIP
  - Validate Confidence format (High/Medium/Low or score/10)
  - ERROR if any required field missing
- **Validate file naming**:
  - Check format: `{type}-{N}-{title}.md`
  - Verify N is a number
  - ERROR if naming doesn't match pattern
- **Check staleness**:
  - Calculate days since Last Verified
  - WARN if Last Verified > 180 days (6 months) and Status is Active
  - WARN if Status is Stale but Last Verified is recent (< 30 days)
- **Validate research artifacts**:
  - Verify Executive Summary exists
  - Check Key Findings section has citations
  - Verify Sources & References section exists
  - WARN if no sources cited
- **Validate glossary artifacts**:
  - Check for category tables structure
  - Verify Alphabetical Index exists
  - Check Total Terms metadata field matches actual term count
  - WARN if mismatch
- **Validate reference artifacts**:
  - Check for Command-First Principle Check section
  - Verify Purpose section exists
  - Check Content section has appropriate structure for reference type
  - WARN if missing command-first check explanation

**Output format**:
```
📚 Artifact Validation:
  ✓ agent/artifacts/research-1-graphql-federation.md (Active, Last Verified: 2026-03-17)
  ⚠️ agent/artifacts/research-2-redis-persistence.md (Active, Last Verified: 2025-09-20, STALE: 180+ days)
  ✓ agent/artifacts/glossary-1-core-terminology.md (Active, 15 terms)
  ✓ agent/artifacts/reference-1-environment-variables.md (Active, command-first check documented)
  ⚠️ agent/artifacts/reference-2-troubleshooting.md (Stale status but Last Verified: 2026-03-10, recent)

  Summary: 5 artifacts validated, 2 warnings
  - 2 potentially stale artifacts (Last Verified > 6 months)
  - 1 status mismatch (marked Stale but recently verified)
```

**Expected Outcome**: Artifact docs are valid, staleness warnings issued  

### 9. Validate Namespace Conventions

Check namespace usage across all files.

**Actions**:
- **Detect Context**: Check if package.yaml exists
  - If exists: This is a package (use package namespace)
  - If not exists: This is a project (use @local namespace)
- **Command Files**: Validate command filenames
  - In packages: Commands MUST use {namespace}.{command}.md format
  - In projects: Local commands MUST use local.{command}.md format
  - Core ACP commands always use acp.{command}.md format
  - ERROR if files missing proper namespace prefix
- **Pattern Files**: Validate pattern filenames
  - In packages: Patterns MUST use {namespace}.{pattern}.md format
  - In projects: Patterns MUST use local.{pattern}.md format
  - ERROR if patterns missing namespace prefix
  - Exception: Template files (*.template.md) don't need namespace
- **Design Files**: Validate design filenames
  - In packages: Designs MUST use {namespace}.{design}.md format
  - In projects: Designs MUST use local.{design}.md format
  - ERROR if designs missing namespace prefix
  - Exception: Template files (*.template.md) don't need namespace
- **Reserved Names**: Check for reserved namespace usage
  - Reject package names: acp, local, core, system, global
  - Reject command files starting with reserved namespaces (unless core ACP)
  - Reject pattern files starting with reserved namespaces (unless core ACP)
  - ERROR for any violations
- **Consistency**: Verify namespace consistency
  - All commands in package use same namespace
  - All patterns in package use same namespace
  - All designs in package use same namespace
  - Namespace matches package.yaml name field (if package)
  - ERROR for mixing of namespaces

**Expected Outcome**: Namespace conventions validated, errors reported for violations  

### 10. Validate Key File Index

Check index files in `agent/index/` for schema correctness and referential integrity.

**Actions**:
- Check that `agent/index/` directory exists (warn if missing)
- For each `*.yaml` file in `agent/index/` (skip `*.template.yaml`):
  - Verify filename follows `{namespace}.{qualifier}.yaml` naming
  - Parse the index entries under the top-level key
  - For each entry, verify required fields present: `path`, `weight`, `kind`, `description`, `rationale`, `applies`
  - Validate `weight` is a number in range 0.0-1.0
  - Validate `kind` is one of: `pattern`, `command`, `design`, `note`, `directive`
    - `requirements` is accepted as a deprecated alias for `design` (warn: "use `design` instead")
    - `artifact` is also accepted for backward compatibility
  - Validate path/kind consistency:
    - If `path` is `null`: `kind` must be `note` or `directive`
    - If `path` is a string: `kind` must be `pattern`, `command`, or `design`
    - For `path: null` entries, `description` must be non-empty (it IS the content)
  - Validate `applies` values use fully qualified command names (contain a dot, e.g. `acp.proceed`)
  - For entries where `path` is a string: check that the path actually exists in the project
  - Warn on missing paths (file may have been moved or deleted)
  - Skip path existence check for `path: null` entries
- Check total indexed entries across all files (warn if > 20)
- Check per-namespace entry count (warn if > 10)

**Output format**:
```
📑 Index Validation:
  ✓ agent/index/local.main.yaml (5 entries, all valid)
  ⚠️ agent/index/core-sdk.main.yaml: path not found: agent/patterns/core-sdk.deleted.md
  ✓ Total: 8 entries across 2 namespaces (within limits)
```

**Expected Outcome**: Index files validated for schema and referential integrity  

### 11. Check Cross-References

Validate links between documents.

**Actions**:
- Extract all internal links from documents
- Verify linked files exist
- Check milestone → task references
- Verify task → milestone back-references
- Validate command → command links
- Note any broken links

**Expected Outcome**: All links are valid  

### 11.5. Driver Binding Consistency (skip if `agent/driver.yaml` absent)

> This step is a no-op if `agent/driver.yaml` does not exist.

If `agent/driver.yaml` exists:

**Actions**:
1. Source `agent/scripts/acp.driver-yaml.sh`
2. Run `driver_validate` — collect any validation errors
3. For each driver of type `mcp`: verify `server:` and `method:` are present
4. For each driver of type `http`: verify `url:` is present
5. Check that `overrides:` keys reference known command names in `agent/commands/`
6. Report: "Driver binding: N drivers configured, M errors found"
7. Non-blocking: validation failures are warnings, not fatal errors

**Expected Outcome**: Driver binding summary reported; issues appear as warnings only.

### 11.6. TypeScript Validator Health Checks (requires `scripts/` dependencies)

Run the TypeScript validator to check structural health outside the document layer.

**Prerequisites**: `npm install` at repo root (one-time, installs tsx + js-yaml)

**Command**: `npx tsx scripts/acp-validate.ts` — **from repo root** (ROOT-anchored since v6.27.0; wrong relative invocations no longer vacuous-pass)

**Actions** (all run automatically when invoked with no arguments):
1. **Placeholder scan** — detects `{PLACEHOLDER}` / `{TODO}` / `{EXAMPLE}` in command files
2. **Frontmatter scan** — validates required YAML fields in routing task files (`agent/routing/tasks/route-*.md`)
3. **Five-surface parity check** — diffs `agent/commands/{acp,git}.*.md` against `.github/prompts/`, `.opencode/commands/`, `.cursor/commands/`, `.claude/commands/`; ERROR on mismatches or dot-form strays
4. **Instruction hash sync** — SHA-256 equality across `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
5. **package.yaml version** — must match `agent/core/identity.yml`
6. **Staleness check** (informational, non-blocking) — warns if `agent/routing/taxonomy.yml` `last_updated` field is >90 days old, or any model `last_verified` in `agent/routing/config.yml` is >180 days old
7. **AGENTS.md size guard** — byte sizes against `agents_md_rules` in `agent/core/constraints.yml` (hard limit: 15KB, warn: 12KB)
8. **sessions.md structure** — validates that each entry has required keys (`date`, `executor`, `tasks`, `done`) per `session.schema.yaml`; exits 1 if malformed

Exit code: 0 only when all error-severity checks pass. Staleness is informational.

**Expected Outcome**: Report from each check. Parity, hash sync, package version, and sessions structure failures are errors.

### 11.7. Validate Command Wrapper Parity (v6.27.0+)

> **Enforced by `scripts/acp-validate.ts` (`validateParityCheck`)** — five surfaces, ERROR severity.

For each `agent/commands/acp.*.md` (excluding templates):
- `.github/prompts/acp-{name}.prompt.md` → required
- `.opencode/commands/acp-{name}.md` → required
- `.cursor/commands/acp-{name}.md` → required
- `.claude/commands/acp-{name}.md` → required

For each `agent/commands/git.*.md`:
- `.cursor/commands/git-{name}.md` and `.claude/commands/git-{name}.md` → required
- prompts/opencode: excluded by design (historical scope)

Dot-form strays (`acp.{name}.md` in wrapper dirs) → ERROR. Run `acp.cursor-commands-sync.sh` + `acp.claude-commands-sync.sh` after command-doc edits.

### 12. Generate Validation Report

Summarize validation results.

**Actions**:
- Count total documents validated
- List any errors found (structural issues — these fail validate)
- List any warnings, including a dedicated **Self-Containment** section populated by Step 5.1 probes
- Provide recommendations
- Suggest fixes for issues
- Compute overall status:
  - **Passed** — no errors, no warnings
  - **Passed with warnings** — no errors, but at least one warning (including self-containment)
  - **Failed** — at least one structural error

Self-containment warnings do NOT fail validate; they appear as warnings. The author decides whether each warning is deliberate scoping or missed inlining.

**Expected Outcome**: Validation report generated with structural results AND self-containment findings clearly separated.  

**Report format**:

```
Validation Report
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Overall: <Passed | Passed with warnings | Failed>

Structural:
  ✓ 12 design documents valid
  ✓ 34 task documents valid (structural)
  ...
  <any ERROR findings>

Self-Containment (incomplete tasks only):
  ⚠️ agent/tasks/milestone-7/task-2-session-freshness-injector.md  (not_started)
     - Probe 1 (spec): covers: R31 but R31's text not reflected in body
       → Inline from agent/specs/local.freshness.md under Spec Coverage

  ⚠️ agent/tasks/milestone-10/task-4-character-grading.md  (in_progress)
     - Probe 2 (design): Design agent/design/acp-commands-design.md has D1..D8
       but task marker has no `incorporates:` field.
       → Add `incorporates:` for relevant D-IDs or justify the omission
     - Probe 3 (clarification): clarification-12-grading.md resolved
       'Karl uses fluency-weighted formula' but not inlined in task body

Cross-References:
  <any broken links or cross-ref issues>

## Examples

### Example 1: Before Committing Changes

**Context**: Made changes to several docs, want to verify before commit  

**Invocation**: `/acp-validate`  

**Result**: Validates all docs, finds 2 broken links, reports them, you fix them before committing  

### Example 2: After Creating New Documents

**Context**: Created 3 new design documents  

**Invocation**: `/acp-validate`  

**Result**: Validates new docs, confirms they follow proper structure, identifies missing section in one doc  

### Example 3: Periodic Quality Check

**Context**: Monthly documentation review  

**Invocation**: `/acp-validate`  

**Result**: Validates all 50+ documents, finds minor formatting issues in 3 files, overall quality is good

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: YAML parsing errors

**Symptom**: progress.yaml fails to parse  

**Cause**: Invalid YAML syntax (indentation, special characters)  

**Solution**: Use YAML validator, check indentation (2 spaces), quote strings with special characters  

### Issue 2: Many broken links reported

**Symptom**: Validation finds numerous broken links  

**Cause**: Files were moved or renamed  

**Solution**: Update links to reflect new file locations, use relative paths, verify files exist  

### Issue 3: Validation takes too long

**Symptom**: Command runs for several minutes  

**Cause**: Very large project with many documents  

**Solution**: This is normal for large projects, consider validating specific directories only, run less frequently

## M70 Validators (v6.26.0)

When `scripts/acp-validate.ts` runs (including via `/acp-validate`), these M70 checks apply:

| Check | Flag / trigger | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| Branch protection docs | always (when `docs/USAGE.md` exists) | warning | `validateBranchProtectionDocs()` — Git Branch Protection checklist; warns if `gh api` shows mainline unprotected |
| Memory field lint | `--memory` | error | `validateMemoryFieldLint()` — required keys on `sessions.md` and `patterns.md` entries |
| Carryover freshness | always | warning | `validateCarryoverFreshness()` — pending carryovers whose `fix_target` snippet already exists in repo |
| IG-35 route drift | always | warning | `validateIg35RouteDrift()` — changed files vs `files_affected` on commit-referenced route |
| Schema enforcement | always | error/warning | `runSchemaEnforcement()` — progress, session, patterns, **lessons**, **decisions** (ADR headers), **audit-carryovers** per-entry |

## M72 Validators (v6.27.0)

| Check | Flag / trigger | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| Repo root anchor | always | error | `assertRepoRoot()` — module-path ROOT; fails if `agent/commands` missing |
| Instruction hash sync | always | error | `validateInstructionFileHash()` — SHA-256 equality AGENTS/CLAUDE/copilot |
| package.yaml version | always | error | `validatePackageYamlVersion()` — must match `identity.yml` |
| Script registration | always | warning | `validateScriptRegistration()` — on-disk `agent/scripts/*.sh` in package.yaml |
| Five-surface parity | always | error | `validateParityCheck()` — 5 surfaces, zero-population fail, dot-stray detection |
| Protocol dir addability | always | error | `validateProtocolDirAddability()` — memory addability probe (ADR-27 reports/feedback local; ADR-28 instance tasks local; ADR-29 designs/patterns/instance routes local) |

**Usage**:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/acp-validate.ts           # standard + schema enforcement
npx tsx scripts/acp-validate.ts --memory  # + memory field lint
```

---

## Security Considerations

### File Access
- **Reads**: All files in `agent/` directory
- **Writes**: None (read-only validation)
- **Executes**: None

### Network Access
- **APIs**: None
- **Repositories**: None

### Sensitive Data
- **Secrets**: Does not access secrets or credentials
- **Credentials**: Does not access credentials files

---

## Notes

- This is a read-only command - it doesn't modify files
- Validation should be fast (< 30 seconds for most projects)
- Run before committing documentation changes
- Integrate into CI/CD pipeline if desired
- Warnings are informational, not failures
- Errors should be fixed before proceeding
- Consider running after major documentation updates
- Can be automated as a pre-commit hook
