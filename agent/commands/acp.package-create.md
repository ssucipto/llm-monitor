**Namespace**: acp  
**Version**: 2.0.0  
**Created**: 2026-02-20  
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-21  
**Status**: Active  
**Scripts**: acp.package-create.sh, acp.common.sh, acp.yaml-parser.sh  

---

**Purpose**: Create a new ACP package with full ACP installation, release branch configuration, and pre-commit hooks  
**Category**: Creation  
**Frequency**: Once per package  

---

## What This Command Does

This command creates a complete ACP package from scratch with:

1. **Full ACP Installation** - Runs `acp.install.sh` to install complete ACP structure
2. **Package Metadata** - Creates `package.yaml` with package information
3. **Release Branch Configuration** - Configures which branch(es) can publish
4. **Pre-Commit Hooks** - Installs validation hooks automatically
5. **Git Repository** - Initializes git with initial commit
6. **Documentation** - Creates README.md, LICENSE, CHANGELOG.md

Unlike the old version, this command:
- ✅ Installs **complete ACP** (all templates, commands, scripts)
- ✅ Configures **release branch** for publishing
- ✅ Installs **pre-commit hooks** for validation
- ❌ Does NOT create example files (use templates instead)

Use this command when starting a new ACP package that you plan to share with others.

---

## Auto-Initialization

When creating packages in `~/.acp/projects/` for the first time, the system automatically initializes `~/.acp/` infrastructure:
- Creates `~/.acp/` directory
- Installs full ACP (templates, scripts, schemas)
- Creates `~/.acp/projects/` directory
- Creates `~/.acp/agent/manifest.yaml` for package tracking

This happens automatically - no manual setup required.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] ACP installed in current directory (to access the script)
- [ ] Git installed on system
- [ ] Basic understanding of what content you want to package
- [ ] (Optional) GitHub account for publishing

### 1. Gather Package Information via Chat

**IMPORTANT**: Collect all information from the user via chat BEFORE executing the script.  

**Actions**:
1. Explain what information is needed and why
2. Ask user for each piece of information one at a time
3. Validate each input before proceeding
4. Summarize all collected information
5. Ask for confirmation before proceeding

**Information to Collect**:

**Package Name** (required)
- Ask: "What would you like to name your package? (lowercase, no spaces, hyphens allowed)"
- Validation: Must be lowercase, alphanumeric, and hyphens only
- Examples: "firebase", "mcp-integration", "oauth-2"
- Note: This becomes the directory name `acp-{name}/`

**Description** (required)
- Ask: "Provide a one-line description of your package:"
- Validation: Should be clear and concise (< 100 characters recommended)
- Examples: "Firebase patterns and utilities for ACP projects"

**Author Name** (required)
- Ask: "What is your name (package author)?"
- Examples: "Patrick Michaelsen", "Your Name"

**License** (optional, default: MIT)
- Ask: "What license would you like to use? (default: MIT)"
- Common options: MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL-3.0, BSD-3-Clause
- Default: MIT if not specified

**Homepage URL** (optional)
- Ask: "What is the homepage URL for this package? (optional, press Enter to skip)"
- Examples: "https://github.com/username/acp-firebase"
- Note: Can be GitHub repo URL or documentation site

**Repository URL** (required)
- Ask: "What is the git repository URL? (e.g., https://github.com/username/acp-{name}.git)"
- Validation: Should be a valid git URL
- Examples: "https://github.com/prmichaelsen/acp-firebase.git"

**Tags** (required)
- Ask: "What tags describe your package? (comma-separated, for discovery)"
- Validation: At least one tag recommended
- Examples: "firebase, firestore, database, backend"
- Note: These help users find your package via `/acp-package-search`

**Release Branch** (optional, default: main)
- Ask: "What branch should be used for publishing? (default: main)"
- Common options: main, master, mainline, release
- Default: main if not specified
- Note: Only commits to this branch can be published

**Target Directory** (optional)
- Ask: "Where would you like to create the package? (default: ~/.acp/projects/{package-name} or $HOME/.acp/projects/{package-name})"
- Supports: Absolute paths, relative paths, `~` expansion, `$HOME` expansion
- Examples: "~/.acp/projects/firebase", "~/dev/packages", "$HOME/packages", "/tmp", "."
- Default: `~/.acp/projects/{package-name}` if not specified (equivalent to `$HOME/.acp/projects/{package-name}`)
- Note: Package will be created in the specified directory
- Rationale: `~/.acp/projects/` is for development work, while `~/.acp/packages/` is reserved for installed packages from remote repositories

**Expected Outcome**: All metadata collected and validated

**Instructions Display**:
```
🎉 Package Created Successfully!

Your ACP package is ready at: ./acp-{package-name}/

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 Next Steps:

1. Add your content:
   - Use /acp-pattern-create to create patterns
   - Use /acp-command-create to create commands
   - Use /acp-design-create to create designs
   
   These commands automatically:
   - Add namespace prefix to filenames
   - Update package.yaml contents section
   - Update README.md "What's Included" section

2. Validate your package:
   cd acp-{package-name}
   /acp-package-validate
   
   This checks:
   - package.yaml structure
   - File existence and namespace consistency
   - Git repository setup
   - README.md structure

3. Create GitHub repository:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: acp-{package-name}
   - Description: {description}
   - Create repository (public recommended)

4. Push to GitHub:
   cd acp-{package-name}
   git remote add origin {repository-url}
   git branch -M {release-branch}
   git push -u origin {release-branch}

5. Add GitHub topic for discoverability:
   - Go to repository settings
   - Add topic: "acp-package" (REQUIRED)
   - Add other topics: {tags}

6. Publish your first version:
   cd acp-{package-name}
   /acp-package-publish
   
   This will:
   - Validate package
   - Detect version bump from commits
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Create git tag
   - Push to remote
   - Test installation

- [`@git.commit`](git.commit.md) - Version-aware commits

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Directory already exists

**Symptom**: Error "Directory acp-{name} already exists"  

**Cause**: Package directory already created  

**Solution**: 
- Choose a different package name
- Or remove existing directory: `rm -rf acp-{name}`
- Or work in existing directory (skip creation steps)

### Issue 2: Git not installed

**Symptom**: Error "git: command not found"  

**Cause**: Git not installed on system  

**Solution**: 
- Install git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Or skip git initialization (manual setup later)

### Issue 3: Invalid package name

**Symptom**: Warning about package name format  

**Cause**: Package name contains spaces or special characters  

**Solution**: 
- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- No spaces or special characters
- Examples: "firebase", "mcp-integration", "oauth-2"

### Issue 4: ACP installation failed

**Symptom**: Error during ACP installation step  

**Cause**: Network issues or repository unavailable  

**Solution**:
- Check internet connection
- Verify GitHub is accessible
- Try again later
- Or manually install ACP: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prmichaelsen/agent-context-protocol/mainline/agent/scripts/acp.install.sh | bash`

### Issue 5: Pre-commit hook not working

**Symptom**: Hook doesn't run or validation fails  

**Cause**: Hook not executable or validation script missing  

**Solution**:
- Make hook executable: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
- Verify validation script exists: `ls agent/scripts/acp.yaml-validate.sh`
- Test hook manually: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

---

## Security Considerations

### File Access
- **Reads**: None (creates new files)
- **Writes**: Creates entire package directory structure
- **Executes**: `acp.install.sh`, `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`

### Network Access
- **APIs**: None
- **Repositories**: Clones agent-context-protocol repository for ACP installation

### Sensitive Data
- **Secrets**: Never include secrets in package files
- **Credentials**: Never commit credentials to git
- **Personal Info**: Only include what you want public

---

## Notes

- Package name becomes directory name: `acp-{name}/`
- Package name in `package.yaml` should NOT include "acp-" prefix
- GitHub repository name should include "acp-" prefix for clarity
- Always add "acp-package" topic to GitHub repository for discoverability
- Update `package.yaml` whenever you add/remove files (or use entity creation commands)
- Follow semantic versioning for package and file versions
- Test package installation before publishing: `/acp-package-validate`
- Use `/acp-package-publish` for automated publishing workflow
- Pre-commit hook validates package.yaml before every commit
- Release branch configuration prevents accidental publishing from wrong branch

---

## Best Practices

### Package Naming
- Use descriptive, single-word names when possible
- Use hyphens for multi-word names (e.g., "mcp-integration")
- Avoid generic names (e.g., "utils", "helpers")
- Be specific about what the package provides

### Content Organization
- **Patterns**: Reusable architectural patterns
- **Commands**: Workflow automation commands
- **Designs**: Technical specifications and architecture docs

### Documentation
- Write clear, concise descriptions
- Include usage examples in README.md
- Document dependencies clearly
- Keep CHANGELOG.md updated
- Add troubleshooting section for common issues

### Version Management
- Start at 1.0.0 for initial release
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Update CHANGELOG.md with each version
- Use `/acp-package-publish` for automated versioning
- Tag releases in git: `git tag v1.0.0`

### GitHub Setup
- Add "acp-package" topic (required for discovery)
- Add descriptive topics/tags
- Write clear repository description
- Include installation instructions in README
- Add LICENSE file
- Consider adding GitHub Actions for validation

### Development Workflow
1. Create package with `/acp-package-create`
2. Add content with `/acp-pattern-create`, `/acp-command-create`, `/acp-design-create`
3. Validate with `/acp-package-validate`
4. Commit changes (pre-commit hook validates automatically)
5. Publish with `/acp-package-publish`
6. Test installation: `/acp-package-install {your-repo-url}`

## Changes from v1.0.0

### Breaking Changes
- **Complete rewrite**: Now installs full ACP instead of minimal structure
- **No example files**: Use templates from ACP installation instead
- **Release branch required**: Must configure release branch for publishing
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automatically installed (validates package.yaml)

### New Features
- Full ACP installation with all templates and commands
- Release branch configuration
- Pre-commit hook installation
- Better error handling and validation
- Clearer next steps and instructions

### Migration Guide

If you have packages created with v1.0.0:

1. **Install full ACP**:
   ```bash
   cd your-package
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prmichaelsen/agent-context-protocol/mainline/agent/scripts/acp.install.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Add release branch to package.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   release:
     branch: main  # or master, mainline, release
   ```

3. **Install pre-commit hook**:
   ```bash
   # In your package directory
   . agent/scripts/acp.common.sh
   install_precommit_hook
   ```

4. **Remove example files** (if present):
   ```bash
   rm agent/patterns/example-pattern.md
   rm agent/commands/example-command.md
   rm agent/design/example-design.md
   ```

5. **Update package.yaml contents** (remove example files from contents section)
