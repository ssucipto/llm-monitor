This command removes installed ACP packages by deleting their files from `agent/` directories and removing their entries from `agent/manifest.yaml`. It can optionally preserve locally modified files to prevent accidental loss of customizations.

Use this command when you no longer need a package, want to clean up unused dependencies, or need to reinstall a package from scratch.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] ACP installed in project
- [ ] `agent/manifest.yaml` exists with installed packages
- [ ] `agent/scripts/acp.package-remove.sh` exists
- [ ] Package to remove is actually installed

```
⚡ /acp-package-remove
  Remove installed ACP packages and clean up manifest

  Usage:
    /acp-package-remove <package-name>             Remove package (prompted)
    /acp-package-remove -y <package-name>          Remove without confirmation
    /acp-package-remove --keep-modified <name>     Keep locally modified files

  Related:
    /acp-package-install       Install packages
    /acp-package-list          List installed packages
    /acp-package-info          Show package details
    /acp-package-update        Update packages
```

### 1. Run Package Remove Script

Execute the remove script with the package name.

**Actions**:
- Run `./agent/scripts/acp.package-remove.sh` with package name:
  ```bash
  # Interactive mode (asks for confirmation)
  ./agent/scripts/acp.package-remove.sh <package-name>
  
  # Auto-confirm mode (skips prompts)
  ./agent/scripts/acp.package-remove.sh -y <package-name>
  
  # Keep modified files
  ./agent/scripts/acp.package-remove.sh --keep-modified <package-name>
  ```
- The script will:
  - Verify package is installed
  - List files that will be removed
  - Detect locally modified files via checksums
  - Ask for confirmation (unless -y flag used)
  - Remove files (or keep modified ones if --keep-modified)
  - Remove package entry from manifest
  - Update manifest timestamp
  - Report removal summary

**Expected Outcome**: Package removed successfully  

### 2. Verify Removal

Check that files were removed correctly.

**Actions**:
- Verify files deleted from `agent/` directories
- Check `agent/manifest.yaml` no longer has package entry
- If `--keep-modified` used, verify modified files were kept
- Confirm no orphaned files remain

**Expected Outcome**: Package completely removed (or modified files kept)  

### 3. Document Removal

Update progress tracking with removal notes.

**Actions**:
- Add note to `agent/progress.yaml` about package removal
- Document which package was removed
- Note removal date
- List any kept files (if --keep-modified used)

**Expected Outcome**: Removal tracked in progress

## Verification

- [ ] Script executed successfully
- [ ] Package files removed from agent/ directories
- [ ] Package entry removed from manifest
- [ ] Modified files kept if --keep-modified used
- [ ] Manifest timestamp updated
- [ ] Removal summary displayed
- [ ] No errors during removal

## Expected Output

### Files Modified
- `agent/manifest.yaml` - Package entry removed, timestamp updated
- `agent/patterns/*.md` - Pattern files deleted
- `agent/commands/*.md` - Command files deleted
- `agent/design/*.md` - Design files deleted

**Invocation**: `/acp-package-remove firebase`  

**Result**: Prompts for confirmation, removes all 6 files, updates manifest  

### Example 2: Remove with Auto-Confirm

**Context**: Want to remove without prompts  

**Invocation**: `/acp-package-remove -y firebase`  

**Result**: Removes package immediately without confirmation  

### Example 3: Keep Modified Files

**Context**: Want to remove package but keep customized files  

**Invocation**: `/acp-package-remove --keep-modified firebase`  

**Result**: Removes 5 unmodified files, keeps 1 modified file, updates manifest  

### Example 4: Package Not Installed

## Related Commands

- [`/acp-package-install`](acp.package-install.md) - Install packages
- [`/acp-package-list`](acp.package-list.md) - List installed packages
- [`/acp-package-info`](acp.package-info.md) - Show package details
- [`/acp-package-update`](acp.package-update.md) - Update packages

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Package not found

**Symptom**: Error "Package not installed"  

**Cause**: Package name incorrect or not installed  

**Solution**: Run `/acp-package-list` to see installed packages, check spelling  

### Issue 2: Files not removed

**Symptom**: Files still exist after removal  

**Cause**: Files were modified and --keep-modified was used  

**Solution**: This is intentional. Remove manually or run without --keep-modified  

### Issue 3: Manifest corrupted after removal

**Symptom**: Manifest has syntax errors  

**Cause**: Rare edge case in awk processing  

**Solution**: Restore from git backup, reinstall packages

## Security Considerations

### File Deletion
- **Deletes**: All files installed by the package
- **Preserves**: Modified files if --keep-modified used
- **Irreversible**: Deleted files cannot be recovered (unless in git)

### Best Practices
- **Use git**: Commit before removing packages
- **Review first**: Use `/acp-package-info` to see what will be removed
- **Keep modified**: Use --keep-modified if you've customized files
- **Backup**: Consider git commit or manual backup before removal

---

## Notes

- Removal is permanent (unless files are in git)
- Modified files detected via checksum comparison
- Manifest entry completely removed
- --keep-modified preserves customizations
- Safe to remove and reinstall packages
- Use `/acp-package-list --modified` to see which files would be kept
