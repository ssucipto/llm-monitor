**Purpose**: Create pattern files with namespace enforcement, draft support, and automatic package updates  
**Category**: Creation  
**Frequency**: As Needed  

---

## What This Command Does

This command creates a new pattern file with intelligent namespace handling, optional draft file support, and automatic updates to package.yaml and README.md. It provides a guided workflow for creating well-structured patterns that follow ACP conventions.

**Key Features**:
- Context-aware (detects if in package vs project)
- Automatic namespace enforcement
- Draft file support with clarification workflow
- Auto-updates package.yaml and README.md
- Uses pattern.template.md as base

**Use this when**: Creating a new pattern in an ACP project or package.  

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] ACP installed in current directory
- [ ] Pattern template exists (agent/patterns/pattern.template.md or similar)
- [ ] (Optional) Draft file prepared if using draft workflow

---

## Arguments

**Context Capture Arguments** (optional — passed to `/acp-clarification-capture` directive):

| Argument | Alias | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `--from-clarification <file>` | `--from-clar` | Capture decisions from a specific clarification file |
| `--from-clarifications` | `--from-clars` | Capture from all recent clarifications |
| `--from-chat-context` | `--from-chat` | Capture decisions from chat conversation |
| `--from-context` | (none) | Shorthand for all sources (clarifications + chat) |
| `--include-clarifications` | (none) | Alias for `--from-clars` |
| `--no-commit` | (none) | Skip the automatic commit step after creation |

**Default behavior** (no flags): Auto-detect clarifications and context in session.

    /acp-design-create     Create designs
    /acp-package-validate  Validate package after creation
```

This step is informational only — do not wait for user input.

### 1. Detect Context

Determine if in package or project directory:

**Actions**:
- Check if package.yaml exists (use `is_acp_package()`)
- If package: Infer namespace from package.yaml, directory, or git remote
- If project: Use "local" namespace

**Expected Outcome**: Context detected, namespace determined  

### 2. Check for Draft File

Check if draft file was provided as argument:

**Syntax**:
- `/acp-pattern-create @my-draft.md` (@ reference)
- `/acp-pattern-create agent/drafts/my-draft.md` (path)
- `/acp-pattern-create` (no draft)

**Actions**:
- If draft provided: Read draft file
- If no draft: Proceed to Step 3

**Expected Outcome**: Draft file read (if provided)  

### 2.5. Read Contextual Key Files

Before creating content, load relevant key files from the index.

**Actions**:
- Check if `agent/index/` directory exists
- If exists, scan for all `*.yaml` files (excluding `*.template.yaml`)
- Filter entries where `applies` includes `acp.pattern-create`
- Sort by weight descending, read matching files
- Produce visible output

**Note**: If `agent/index/` does not exist, skip silently.  

### 2.6. Review Existing Patterns

Review existing patterns before creating a new one to ensure consistency.

**Actions**:
- List all files in `agent/patterns/`
- Read patterns similar to what is being created (by topic or name)
- Check for duplication — if an equivalent pattern already exists, warn the user
- Note the style, structure, and conventions of existing patterns
- Ensure the new pattern will follow consistent style

**Note**: If `agent/patterns/` is empty or does not exist, skip silently.  

### 2.7. Capture Clarification Context

Invoke the `/acp-clarification-capture` shared directive to capture decisions from clarifications and/or chat context.

**Actions**:
- Read and follow the directive in [`agent/commands/acp.clarification-capture.md`](acp.clarification-capture.md)
- Pass through any `--from-*` arguments from this command's invocation
- If no `--from-*` flags specified: auto-detect clarifications in session (default behavior)
- If uncaptured clarifications detected, show warning and ask user whether to include
- Directive returns a "Key Design Decisions" markdown section (or nothing if no context)
- Hold the generated section for insertion during Step 5 (Generate Pattern File)

**Expected Outcome**: Key Design Decisions section generated (if context available), or skipped cleanly  

### 3. Collect Pattern Information

Gather information from user via chat:

**Information to Collect**:
- **Pattern name** (without namespace prefix)
  - Example: "user-scoped-collections" (not "firebase.user-scoped-collections")
  - Validation: lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens
- **Pattern description** (one-line summary)
  - Example: "User-scoped Firestore data organization"
- **Pattern version** (default: 1.0.0)

**If no draft provided**:
- Ask: "Describe what you want this pattern to accomplish" OR
- Offer: "Would you like to create an empty draft file first?"

**Expected Outcome**: All pattern metadata collected  

### 4. Process Draft (If Provided)

If draft file was provided, create clarification:

**Actions**:
- Analyze draft for clarity and completeness
- If draft is clear and complete: Skip clarification, use draft content
- If draft is ambiguous: Create clarification document
  - Find next clarification number
  - Create `agent/clarifications/clarification-{N}-pattern-{name}.md`
  - Generate questions about unclear aspects
  - Wait for user to answer clarification
  - Read answered clarification

**Expected Outcome**: Clarification created and answered (if needed)  

### 5. Generate Pattern File

Create pattern file from template:

**Actions**:
- Determine full filename: `{namespace}.{pattern-name}.md`
- Copy from pattern template
- Fill in metadata (name, version, date, description)
- If draft/clarification provided: Incorporate content
- If no draft: Create from template with user-provided description
- If Key Design Decisions section was generated in Step 2.7: Insert it into the pattern document
- **Populate the `/acp-meta.pattern` marker block** — the template ships with `{placeholder}` values; replace every one:
  - `topic:` — comma-separated keywords from the pattern name + description
  - `description:` — one-line summary, <=150 chars
  - `applies_to:` — comma-separated contexts (e.g. `data-access, auth, testing`) — from Step 3 user input
  - `status:` — literal `active`
  - `updated:` — today's ISO date
  - No `{placeholder}` text may remain.
- Save to `agent/patterns/{namespace}.{pattern-name}.md`

**Expected Outcome**: Pattern file created  

### 6. Update package.yaml (If in Package)

Add pattern to package.yaml contents:

**Actions**:
- Read package.yaml
- Add entry to contents.patterns array:
  ```yaml
  - name: {namespace}.{pattern-name}.md
    version: 1.0.0
    description: {description}
  ```
- Save package.yaml

**Expected Outcome**: package.yaml updated  

### 7. Update README.md (If in Package)

Update README contents section:

**Actions**:
- Call `update_readme_contents()` from common.sh
- Regenerates "What's Included" section from package.yaml

**Expected Outcome**: README.md updated with new pattern  

### 8. Prompt to Delete Draft (If Used)

If draft file was used, ask to delete it:

**Actions**:
- Ask: "Would you like to delete the draft file? (yes/no)"
- If yes: Delete draft file
- If no: Keep draft file

**Expected Outcome**: User chooses whether to keep draft  

### 9. Report Success

Display what was created:

**Output**:
```
✅ Pattern Created Successfully!

File: agent/patterns/{namespace}.{pattern-name}.md
Namespace: {namespace}
Version: 1.0.0

✓ Pattern file created
✓ package.yaml updated (if package)
✓ README.md updated (if package)
✓ Draft file deleted (if requested)

Next steps:
- Edit the pattern file to add implementation details
- Run /acp-package-validate to verify (if package)
```

**Expected Outcome**: User knows pattern was created successfully  

### 10. Prompt to Add to Key File Index

After successful creation, offer to add the new file to the index (if `agent/index/` exists).

**Display**:
```
Would you like to add this to the key file index?
  - Yes, add to agent/index/local.main.yaml
  - No, skip
```

If yes, prompt for weight (suggest 0.8 for patterns), description, rationale, and applies values. Add entry to `agent/index/local.main.yaml`.

**Note**: Skip silently if `agent/index/` does not exist.

### 11. Commit Created Artifacts (MANDATORY unless `--no-commit`)

> **⚠️ CRITICAL**: This step is NOT optional unless `--no-commit` was specified. You MUST commit created artifacts before finishing. Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT ask the user whether to commit. Do NOT defer the commit to a later time. If `--no-commit` was passed, skip this step silently.

**Actions**:
- Stage all files created or modified during pattern creation:
  - Pattern file (`agent/patterns/{namespace}.{pattern-name}.md`)
  - `package.yaml` (if updated)
  - `README.md` (if updated)
  - Key file index (`agent/index/*.yaml`) if updated
- Do NOT stage clarification files (`agent/clarifications/*.md`) — these are not committed
- Invoke `@git.commit` with a message summarizing what was created (e.g., `feat(pattern): create {namespace}.{pattern-name} pattern`)
- Verify the commit succeeded

**Expected Outcome**: All pattern artifacts committed to version control.

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating Pattern in Package

**Context**: In acp-firebase package directory  

**Invocation**: `/acp-pattern-create`  

**Interaction**:
```
Agent: Detected package context. Namespace: firebase

Agent: What would you like to name your pattern? (without namespace prefix)
User: user-scoped-collections

Agent: Provide a one-line description:
User: User-scoped Firestore data organization

Agent: Pattern version? (default: 1.0.0)
User: [Enter]

✅ Pattern Created Successfully!

File: agent/patterns/firebase.user-scoped-collections.md
Namespace: firebase
Version: 1.0.0

✓ Pattern file created
✓ package.yaml updated
✓ README.md updated
```

### Example 2: Creating Pattern with Draft

**Context**: Have draft file describing pattern  

**Invocation**: `/acp-pattern-create @my-pattern-draft.md`  

**Result**: Reads draft, creates clarification if needed, generates pattern, updates package files  

### Example 3: Creating Pattern in Project

**Context**: In regular project (no package.yaml)  

**Invocation**: `/acp-pattern-create`  

**Result**: Uses "local" namespace, creates a gitignored instance pattern (`local.*` under `agent/patterns/`; ADR-29), no package updates

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Namespace inference failed

**Symptom**: Cannot determine namespace  

**Solution**: Provide namespace manually when prompted, or check package.yaml exists and has name field  

### Issue 2: Invalid pattern name

**Symptom**: Pattern name rejected  

**Solution**: Use lowercase, alphanumeric, and hyphens only. No spaces or special characters.  

### Issue 3: package.yaml update failed

**Symptom**: Error updating package.yaml  

**Solution**: Verify package.yaml exists and is valid YAML. Run /acp-package-validate to check.

## Notes

- Pattern name should be descriptive and specific
- Namespace is automatically added to filename
- Draft files can be any format (free-form markdown)
- Clarifications are created only if draft is ambiguous
- package.yaml and README.md updates are automatic in packages
- In non-package projects, uses "local" namespace
