**Namespace**: acp  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Created**: 2026-02-26  
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-26  
**Status**: Experimental  
**Scripts**: acp.project-remove.sh  

---

**Purpose**: Remove a project from the global registry with optional directory deletion  
**Category**: Project Management  
**Frequency**: As Needed  

---

## What This Command Does

This command removes a project from the global ACP project registry at `~/.acp/projects.yaml`. It provides two removal modes:

1. **Registry Only** (default): Removes project metadata from registry, preserves directory
2. **Complete Removal** (--delete-files): Removes from registry AND deletes project directory

The command includes safety features:
- Confirmation prompts before removal
- Extra confirmation for directory deletion (requires typing "DELETE")
- Warning if removing the current project
- Updates `current_project` to empty if removing current
- Lists remaining projects after removal

**Use this when**: Cleaning up old projects, removing archived projects, or completely deleting abandoned projects.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Global ACP installed (`~/.acp/` exists)

⚡ /acp-project-remove
  Remove a project from the global registry with optional directory deletion

  Usage:
    /acp-project-remove <name>                     Remove from registry only
    /acp-project-remove <name> --delete-files       Also delete project directory
    /acp-project-remove <name> -y                   Skip confirmation prompts

  Related:
    /acp-project-list        List all projects
    /acp-project-set         Switch to another project
    /acp-project-info        Show project details
    /acp-project-update      Update project metadata
```

### 1. Run Shell Script

Execute the project-remove script with the project name and options.

**Actions**:
- Run: `./agent/scripts/acp.project-remove.sh <project-name> [options]`
- Script validates project exists in registry
- Script displays project information
- Script prompts for confirmation
- Script removes from registry
- Script optionally deletes directory

**Expected Outcome**: Project removed from registry  

### 2. Verify Removal

Confirm the project was removed successfully.

**Actions**:
- Check success message displays project name
- Verify project no longer in registry
- Check if directory was deleted (if --delete-files used)
- Note if current_project was cleared

**Expected Outcome**: Project removed, registry updated  

### 3. Switch to Another Project (If Needed)

If removed project was current, switch to another project.

**Actions**:
- Run `/acp-project-list` to see remaining projects
- Run `/acp-project-set <name>` to switch to another project
- Or continue without a current project

**Expected Outcome**: New project context established (if needed)

### Registry Changes

**Before**:
```yaml
current_project: old-project

projects:
  old-project:
    type: web-app
    status: archived
    path: /home/user/.acp/projects/old-project
    # ... other fields
  
  active-project:
    type: mcp-server
    # ... other fields

last_updated: 2026-02-24T17:00:00Z
```

**After**:
```yaml
current_project: ""  # Cleared if removed project was current

projects:
  active-project:
    type: mcp-server
    # ... other fields

last_updated: 2026-02-26T18:00:00Z  # Updated
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Remove from Registry Only

**Context**: Project archived, want to clean up registry but keep files  

**Invocation**: `/acp-project-remove old-project`  

**Result**: 
- Project removed from registry
- Directory preserved at original location
- Can still access files manually
- Registry cleaned up

### Example 2: Complete Removal

**Context**: Abandoned project, want to delete everything  

**Invocation**: `/acp-project-remove abandoned-project --delete-files`  

**Result**:
- Project removed from registry
- Directory deleted from filesystem
- All project files gone
- Complete cleanup

### Example 3: Auto-Confirm Removal

**Context**: Scripting or automation, want to skip prompts  

**Invocation**: `/acp-project-remove old-project -y`  

**Result**:
- No confirmation prompts
- Project removed immediately
- Useful for scripts and automation

### Example 4: Remove Current Project

**Context**: Removing the project you're currently working on  

**Invocation**: `/acp-project-remove current-project`  

**Result**:
- Warning displayed about removing current project
- Project removed from registry
- `current_project` cleared in registry
- Suggestion to switch to another project

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Project not found in registry

**Symptom**: Error "Project 'X' not found in registry"  

**Cause**: Project not registered or typo in name  

**Solution**: 
- Run `/acp-project-list` to see available projects
- Check spelling of project name
- Project may already be removed

### Issue 2: Registry file not found

**Symptom**: Error "Project registry not found"  

**Cause**: Global ACP not initialized or registry deleted  

**Solution**:
- No action needed if no projects exist
- Run `/acp-project-create` to create new project (initializes registry)

### Issue 3: Cannot delete directory

**Symptom**: Error during directory deletion  

**Cause**: Permission issues or directory in use  

**Solution**:
- Check file permissions
- Close any programs using the directory
- Manually delete directory: `rm -rf /path/to/project`

### Issue 4: Confirmation prompt not appearing

**Symptom**: Script removes project without asking  

**Cause**: -y/--yes flag used  

**Solution**:
- This is expected behavior with -y flag
- Remove -y flag if you want confirmation prompts

---

## Security Considerations

### File Access
- **Reads**: `~/.acp/projects.yaml` (registry)
- **Writes**: `~/.acp/projects.yaml` (removes project entry)
- **Deletes**: Project directory (only with --delete-files flag)

### Dangerous Operations
- **Directory Deletion**: Requires explicit --delete-files flag and "DELETE" confirmation
- **No Undo**: Deleted directories cannot be recovered (use git backups)
- **Current Project**: Clears current_project if removing current

### Best Practices
- **Backup First**: Commit and push changes before removing
- **Archive Status**: Consider marking as archived instead of removing
- **Registry Only**: Default behavior preserves files for safety
- **Double Confirm**: Directory deletion requires typing "DELETE"

---

## Notes

- **Default Behavior**: Removes from registry only, preserves directory
- **Safety First**: Multiple confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- **Current Project**: Automatically cleared if removing current project
- **Timestamps**: Updates registry `last_updated` timestamp
- **No Undo**: Registry removal can be undone manually, directory deletion cannot
- **Automation**: Use -y flag for scripting (skips prompts)
- **Related Projects**: Does not remove related projects (only specified project)
- **Tags**: Project tags are removed with the project
