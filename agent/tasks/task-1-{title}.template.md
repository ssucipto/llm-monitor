**Estimated Time**: [e.g., "2 hours", "4 hours", "1 day"]

## Objective

[Clearly state what this task accomplishes. Be specific and focused on a single, achievable goal.]

**Example**: "Create the basic project structure with all necessary configuration files and directory organization for a TypeScript-based MCP server."  

---

## Context

[Provide background information that helps understand why this task is necessary and how it fits into the larger milestone.]

**Example**: "This task establishes the foundation for the project. Without proper structure and configuration, subsequent development tasks cannot proceed. The structure follows industry best practices for TypeScript projects and MCP server organization."  

---

## Steps

[Provide a detailed, sequential list of actions to complete this task. Each step should be concrete and actionable.]

### 1. [Step Category or Action]
[Detailed description of what to do]

```bash
# Command examples if applicable
command --with-flags
```

```typescript
// Code examples if applicable
const example = "code";
```

### 2. [Next Step]
[Detailed description]

### 3. [Next Step]
[Detailed description]

**Example**:

### 1. Create Project Directory
Create the root directory for the project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir -p my-project
cd my-project
```

### 2. Initialize npm Project
Initialize a new npm project with default settings:

```bash
npm init -y
```

### 3. Update package.json
Edit the generated package.json to include proper metadata and scripts:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Description of what this project does",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "node esbuild.build.js",
    "dev": "tsx watch src/index.ts",
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
    "test": "vitest",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
  },
  "keywords": ["mcp", "relevant", "keywords"],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

### 4. Create Directory Structure
Create all necessary directories:

```bash
mkdir -p src/{types,utils,tools}
mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration}
mkdir -p agent/{design,milestones,patterns,tasks}
```

### 5. Create Configuration Files
Create TypeScript configuration, build scripts, and other config files.

**tsconfig.json**:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "Node16",
    "moduleResolution": "Node16",
    "lib": ["ES2022"],
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "sourceMap": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist", "tests"]
}
```

[Continue with other config files...]

## User-Observable Acceptance

<!-- REQUIRED. At least one user-observable acceptance criterion, OR an
     N/A line with a justification of >= 10 characters.

     An observable criterion is something you could check in a fresh
     browser session, CLI invocation, API call, or file on disk AFTER
     the task is complete. Backend-only "it compiles" is not observable.

     If the task genuinely has no user-observable outcome (pure refactor,
     internal rename, dev tooling, test-only changes), explicitly say so:

         N/A — <one-sentence reason, e.g. "internal refactor; no behavior change">

     Feature work should NEVER be N/A. If you're writing an N/A for a
     feature, stop and identify the observable effect.

     acp.proceed validates this section after the task is marked complete. -->

- [ ] In a fresh session, the user can [specific observable thing]
- [ ] [Observable change in UI / output / API response]

**Example**:
- [ ] In a fresh browser session, hovering any German word in an Iris message shows a popover with article, gloss, and CEFR level
- [ ] `GET /api/word?q=Abfahrt&lang=de` returns JSON matching the schema in Step 2
- [ ] `agent/tasks/milestone-N/task-M-foo.md` file exists on disk with the content from Step 6

---

## Spec Coverage (Optional)

<!-- Populated automatically by @acp.task-create when a spec at
     agent/specs/ matches the task topic. Lists the specific requirement
     IDs (R<N>) and behavior table rows this task implements.

     Leave this section out entirely if no spec applies — acp.proceed
     does NOT require it. When present, each item should be checked
     off or explicitly deferred before marking the task complete.

     Format:

         **Source**: agent/specs/local.feature-name.md

         Covered requirements:
         - [ ] R<N>: <short description copied verbatim from spec>
         - [ ] R<M>: <short description>

         Covered behaviors (from Behavior Table):
         - [ ] <scenario name / row id>
-->

<!-- QUALITY GATE (required for backend and frontend tasks):
     Before writing verification checklist items, cross-reference against the actual codebase:
     1. Field names  — read the Pydantic model / DB schema; confirm every field name used here exists
     2. Enum values  — read the enum definition; confirm values are valid members (not free strings)
     3. Import paths — read the file tree; confirm all import sources exist (frontend tasks)
     4. HTTP methods — read the route decorator; confirm method + path match exactly
     5. Response shape — read the API endpoint; confirm response field names match what you verify
     Checklist items with wrong names or methods create implementation bugs that silently
     pass during review but fail at runtime.                                                 -->

## Verification

[Provide a checklist of items to verify the task is complete. Each item should be objectively verifiable.]

- [ ] Verification item 1: [Specific condition to check]
- [ ] Verification item 2: [Specific condition to check]
- [ ] Verification item 3: [Specific condition to check]
- [ ] Verification item 4: [Specific condition to check]
- [ ] Verification item 5: [Specific condition to check]

**Example**:
- [ ] Project directory created and contains expected subdirectories
- [ ] package.json exists and contains correct metadata
- [ ] tsconfig.json exists and is valid JSON
- [ ] All configuration files created (.gitignore, .env.example, etc.)
- [ ] Directory structure matches specification
- [ ] No syntax errors in configuration files

## Expected Output

[Describe what the project should look like after this task is complete.]

**File Structure**:
```
project-root/
├── file1
├── file2
└── directory/
    └── file3
```

**Key Files Created**:
- `file1`: [Purpose]

## Key Design Decisions (Optional)

<!-- This section is populated by @acp.clarification-capture when
     create commands are invoked with --from-clar, --from-chat, or
     --from-context. It can also be manually authored.
     Omit this section entirely if no decisions to capture.

     Group decisions by agent-inferred category using tables:

### {Category}

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| {decision} | {choice} | {rationale} |

## Common Issues and Solutions

[Document potential problems and how to resolve them:]

### Issue 1: [Problem description]
**Symptom**: [What the user will see]  
**Solution**: [How to fix it]  

### Issue 2: [Problem description]
**Symptom**: [What the user will see]  
**Solution**: [How to fix it]  

**Example**:

### Issue 1: npm init fails
**Symptom**: Error message about permissions or missing npm  
**Solution**: Ensure Node.js and npm are installed correctly. Run `node --version` and `npm --version` to verify.  

### Issue 2: TypeScript configuration errors
**Symptom**: tsc complains about invalid configuration  
**Solution**: Validate JSON syntax in tsconfig.json. Ensure all required fields are present.
