# Milestone 3: Production Hardening

## Goal

Prepare the platform for production readiness by adding external
integrations, audit trail, comprehensive test coverage, complete
documentation, and security hardening. After this milestone the
application should be deployable with confidence.

## Tasks

| #  | Task                  | Description                                              |
|----|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 11 | Webhooks              | Webhook registration, payload signing, delivery with retry |
| 12 | Audit Logging         | Immutable audit log for all state-changing operations     |
| 13 | Comprehensive Tests   | Full test suite covering auth, CRUD, permissions, events  |
| 14 | API Documentation     | README, ARCHITECTURE.md, MIGRATION.md, inline route docs  |
| 15 | Security Hardening    | Rate limiting, input sanitization, security headers, CORS |

## Deliverables

- Webhook management API (register, list, delete per workspace)
- Signed webhook payloads delivered on domain events with retry logic
- Audit log store recording actor, action, resource, and diff
- Audit log query endpoint filtered by workspace, user, and date range
- Jest + Supertest test suite achieving 90%+ code coverage
- README with setup instructions, ARCHITECTURE.md with system overview
- MIGRATION.md documenting the refactoring changes from milestone 1
- Helmet security headers, CORS configuration, basic rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization on all user-supplied fields

## Success Criteria

- `npm test` passes with zero failures and coverage above 90%
- Webhook payloads are delivered and can be verified via signature
- Audit log captures every create, update, and delete operation
- Documentation is complete: a new developer can set up and understand the system
- Security headers are present on all responses (verified via curl)
- Rate limiting rejects excessive requests with 429 status
- No open security issues identified in a manual review
