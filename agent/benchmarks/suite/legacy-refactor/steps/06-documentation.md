   - Query parameters (search, sort, order, limit, offset)
   - Response format with examples
   - Error responses
5. **Example curl commands** — Working curl examples for each endpoint
6. **Architecture Overview** — Explain the project directory structure and the responsibility of each module (routes, middleware, store, etc.)
7. **Refactoring Decisions** — A section explaining what was changed from the original legacy code and why (reference REFACTOR_PLAN.md)
